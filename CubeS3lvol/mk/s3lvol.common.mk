# Default to deps/aws or the builder prebuilt; never a system prefix.
#
# === Why no fallback ===
#
# A fallback looks friendly but is a silent reproducibility hole, and it has
# already bitten once: /usr/local/aws on this machine was installed by another
# project, and its aws-c-s3 carries an uncommitted local change (excluding the
# 404 from the "Meta request cannot recover" ERROR log). The same tag v0.8.7
# therefore had different sources in the two places, and the build system
# picked one by prefix order without printing which.
#
# The result was behaviour varying per machine with no hint at all. While
# tracking it down I first blamed the wrong thing (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE), because
# the same tag made me assume the sources were identical -- which is exactly
# what this fallback costs: "what is actually linked" turns into an
# archaeological question.
#
# An explicit AWS_INSTALL_DIR override still works (e.g. /usr/local/aws); it
# just has to be stated. The criterion is the header, not the directory:
# setup_dep.sh interrupted halfway leaves an empty directory, and pointing -I
# at a useless path only makes the errors harder to read.

# Compilation options.
#
# === build type ===
#
# S3LVOL_BUILD_TYPE = debug (default) | release, and it only controls this
# project's own code. There are three independent knobs and they neither move
# together nor should:
#
#   this project  S3LVOL_BUILD_TYPE=debug        (here)
#   SPDK          ./configure --enable-debug     (setup_dep.sh default)
#   AWS CRT       AWS_BUILD_TYPE=Debug           (setup_dep.sh default)
#
# debug uses the same flag set as SPDK's own CONFIG_DEBUG=y
# (spdk/mk/spdk.common.mk:295): -DDEBUG -g3 -O0 -fno-omit-frame-pointer.
# Matching it means the two sides' stacks and variables are equally visible
# when crossing the boundary in gdb.
#
# === -DDEBUG is the point, not -O0 ===
#
# SPDK's SPDK_DEBUGLOG / SPDK_LOGDUMP are gated on #ifdef DEBUG in
# include/spdk/log.h:183; without the macro they expand to empty statements.
# Which means that before this change, the SPDK_DEBUGLOG calls in this
# project's sources were never compiled into the binary at all, and no runtime
# flag could produce any output.
#
# That failure is hard to infer from symptoms: the code is there, the flag is
# accepted, logs just do not appear -- it looks like the path is never reached.
# Only the compile options reveal it.
#
# === assert is alive under both modes ===
#
# assert() is controlled by NDEBUG, and neither build type defines it, so the
# 65 asserts stay live under release too -- matching today's behaviour (today
# has neither -DDEBUG nor -DNDEBUG). This is deliberate: turning asserts off
# is a decision to review on its own, because once an assert has side effects,
# NDEBUG silently changes behaviour. If they ever need to go, do it then.
#
# === The macro is ABI-safe ===
#
# In SPDK's public headers #ifdef DEBUG appears in log.h only, affecting no
# structure layout. So the project and the SPDK libraries disagreeing on this
# macro is harmless -- conversely, the earlier combination of "SPDK built with
# -DDEBUG, this project without" was always safe too, it just threw the logs
# away.

# switching makes the target not exist, the rule runs, the new stamp is newer
# than every .o, and everything rebuilds. That is one comparison fewer than
# "store a file and diff its content", and it cannot end up with content that
# does not match the name.

# With the stamp rule above, `make` would become "create the stamp and stop":
# not a single .o built, and because the rule is silent (@), no output at all,
# exit code still 0.
#
# That fooled me once: after changing the compile options I ran make, got no
# error and no output, which looked like "nothing to rebuild" -- but nothing
# had been built at all, and I went hunting for why -DDEBUG did not take
# effect against the old .o files. The lesson is that "no output + exit 0" is
# not the same as "nothing happened"; for a build you have to watch how many
# times cc actually ran.

# Clearing .DEFAULT_GOAL makes make fall back to "the first target defined
# afterwards".

# Not an optimisation -- without it, editing a header rebuilds nothing, and the

# where one file reads a field at an offset another file writes something else to.
#
# It has already happened once: inserting a field into the middle of
# struct s3_lvs_opts moved everything after it, only the edited .c files were
# recompiled, and the stale ones went on reading opts->force from the old offset.
# The symptom was an attach refusing force=true, several layers away from the
# cause.
#
# -MMD writes a .d alongside each .o, listing the headers it included. -MP adds a
# phony target for each of those headers, so deleting or renaming one is a rebuild
# rather than a "No rule to make target" failure. Each directory's Makefile
# -includes the .d files it generates.

# DPDK: link the archives, not the shared objects
#
# The binaries get released as a package and copied to machines that have no SPDK
# tree, so nothing may be resolved at run time from $(SPDK_ROOT). SPDK's own
# libraries are already static here -- build/lib holds 76 .a and no .so, because
# CONFIG_SHARED=n -- and libaws.a is an archive too. DPDK was the one part still
# linked dynamically, and not by anyone's choice:
#
# pkg-config --libs spdk_env_dpdk returns "-L<dpdk>/lib -lrte_eal -lrte_kvargs
#   ...", that directory holds both librte_eal.a and librte_eal.so, and -l prefers
#   the shared object. The result was 30 librte_*.so.26 dependencies pinned to an
#   absolute path by two -Wl,-rpath flags -- which is why it *worked* here and
#   would have failed on the first machine without this checkout.
#
# So the -lrte_* that pkg-config hands back are rewritten into full paths to the
# .a files, which is the same trick the app Makefile already documents for
# libs3lvol_bdev.a: naming the archive outright is the only way to keep the linker
# from preferring a .so that sits next to it.
#
# === These have to be inside --whole-archive ===
#
# Not for symmetry with SPDK's libraries but for the same reason: DPDK's buses,
# mempool handlers and power management drivers all register themselves from
# RTE_INIT constructors with nothing referencing them by symbol
# (librte_bus_pci.a, librte_mempool_ring.a, librte_power_*.a). A plain static link
# drops those objects, and DPDK's own libdpdk.pc says as much -- its Libs.private
# is one big -Wl,--whole-archive ... -l:librte_*.a list. SPDK does the same thing
# in lib/env_dpdk/env.mk:117 (DPDK_STATIC_LIB_LINKER_ARGS). This is also where the
# app Makefile's old comment was wrong: "DPDK's libraries do not need it, they are
# referenced explicitly" holds for the shared build, where the constructors run at
# dlopen time regardless, and not for this one.
#
# The failure mode is a run-time one, not a link error: EAL comes up and then
# cannot find a bus to probe, or a mempool ops named "ring".
#
# The three private dependencies (-lnuma -ldl, plus rte_eal wanting -lpthread)
# come from spdk_syslibs, which every link here already pulls in.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Both take a pkg-config --libs output and split it in two: the -lrte_* become
# archive paths, everything else (the -lspdk_* and the -L flags) is passed through
# untouched, because SPDK's libraries are named as -l on purpose -- there is no .so
# beside them to be confused with.

# OpenSSL: link the archives, not the shared objects
#
# The Ubuntu 20.04 builder has libssl.so.1.1. Newer distros (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04,
# Debian 12, many EL9 images without compat-openssl11) ship only OpenSSL 3.
# 1.1 and 3.x are different SONAMEs, so a binary that DT_NEEDED libssl.so.1.1
# will not start there. glibc is the other way around (old baseline, new host),
# which is why the builder stays on 20.04; OpenSSL is the library that breaks
# that rule.
#
# -lssl prefers libssl.so sitting next to libssl.a (same class of bug as DPDK
# above). -Wl,-Bstatic -lssl is worse: pkg-config --libs --static spdk_syslibs
# often emits -lssl -lcrypto again, and a later -Bdynamic would pull the .so
# back in -- or -Bstatic would leak onto glibc. Name the .a files outright, and
# drop -lssl/-lcrypto from any syslibs list that still carries them.
#
# libssl.a before libcrypto.a. Keep these *outside* --whole-archive: OpenSSL
# does not register constructors the way SPDK/DPDK do, and wrapping it would
# pull unused ENGINE objects. -ldl -pthread stay dynamic (OpenSSL 1.1 needs
# them).
#
# The archive may also need -lz, which the .so never does because it carries its
# own DT_NEEDED. Distros disagree: TencentOS/RHEL build libcrypto with zlib
# compression, so c_zlib.o refers to inflate/deflate and the link fails without
# it, while Debian's is built no-comp. Probed rather than always appended, so a
# builder that does not need zlib does not gain a dependency on it.
