#  rcow_stop.sh -- take the rcow data plane down without losing writes
#
#  Order, and what each step is for:
#
#    1. nvme disconnect     stop the host from issuing new I/O. Doing this after
#                           the unload instead would leave a mounted filesystem
#                           writing into a namespace whose lvstore is gone, which
#                           the host reports as I/O errors on a device that was
#                           working a second ago.
#    2. rcow_unload_lvstore drain everything acknowledged so far into S3 and close
#                           the log. This is the only clean shutdown on the WAL
#                           path; killing the process instead is safe but leaves a
#                           tail that the next attach has to replay.
#    3. SIGTERM the target  and SIGKILL only after the budget runs out.
#
#  === What is deliberately not done ===
#
#  Volumes are not deactivated. /data/cubelet/rcow/active_lvols is the record
#  of the
#  host-side layout, and it is what rcow_start.sh replays; emptying it here would
#  turn every planned restart into a node that comes back with no volumes
#  exposed. The namespaces disappear with the process either way.
#
#  bstore.json is not touched either, for the same reason from the other
#  direction: it is what tells the next start to attach rather than create.
#
#  === The budget ===
#
#  RCOW_STOP_TIMEOUT (default 120s) covers all three steps together, not each. An
#  unload that is still flushing at the deadline is interrupted, because a stop
#  that can hang indefinitely is not a stop -- and the WAL means interrupting it
#  costs a longer attach next time, not data.
#
#  Usage: rcow_stop.sh [--force] [--lvs-name NAME]
#
#    --force           skip the unload and go straight to signalling. For a
#                      target that is wedged; the next attach replays the log.
#    --lvs-name        unload this lvstore instead of the one derived from the
#                      hostname. Needed when the target was started with
#                      rcow_start.sh --lvs-name; without it the unload would
#                      miss the attached lvstore and only the WAL replay would
#                      save the shutdown.
#
#  --keep-connected is accepted but refused: it reads as "leave the host
#  connected", yet it skipped the disconnect while still unloading the lvstore,
#  and the unload hands the host namespace-removal AENs -- a silent
#  hot-removal, worse than the plain stop it looked like. A hot restart is
#  rcow_upgrade.sh.
