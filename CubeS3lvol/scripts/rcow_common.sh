#
#  === Why these scripts exist at all ===
#
#  s3lvol_tgt comes up empty: no bdevs, no NVMf transport, no subsystems, no
#  lvstore. Every one of those has to be re-established after each boot, in an
#  order where two of the steps are dangerous to get wrong:
#
#    - create vs. attach of the lvstore. Create formats the WAL device; attach
#      replays it. Choosing create when an lvstore already exists destroys the
#      only copy of writes that were acknowledged but not yet in S3. The choice
#      is therefore made from /data/cubelet/rcow/bstore.json and from nothing
#      else -- never from "the attach failed, so let us try create".
#
#    - reproducing the host-side namespace layout. Which volume sat on which
#      subsystem and nsid is recorded in /data/cubelet/rcow/active_lvols,
#      because it
#      cannot be recomputed: the nsid of a volume that was moved is not its
#      hash, and the host's /dev/nvmeXnY numbering follows discovery order.
#
#  === The subsystem grid ===
#
#  RCOW_NUM_SUBSYS subsystems, each created with max_namespaces =
#  RCOW_NS_PER_SUBSYS, all listening on the same address and port, all connected
#  by the initiator at startup. Both numbers must match RCOW_NUM_SUBSYS and
#  RCOW_NS_PER_SUBSYS in module/bdev/s3lvol/vbdev_s3lvol.h, and the NQN pattern
#  must match RCOW_NQN_PREFIX plus a two-digit index there: the module derives
#  the NQN it attaches to from the same arithmetic, and a mismatch shows up as
#  "subsystem N does not exist" from rcow_active_bdev.
#
#  The -m flag on nvmf_create_subsystem is not optional. Without it a subsystem
#  defaults to 32 namespaces and any nsid above that is refused with "NSID
#  greater than maximum not allowed" -- a message that only appears in the target
#  log, while the RPC just reports a failed add.

# Guard against being sourced twice: rcow_recovery.sh may hand over to
# rcow_start.sh, and re-running the derivations below would be harmless but the
# guard makes it obvious that it does not happen.

# It is a transport option, not a subsystem one, and it is what the host is told:
# ctrlr.c:3264 derives MDTS from it as log2(max_io_size / 4096), so the initiator's
# max_hw_sectors_kb follows. At the default the kernel cuts every 1 MiB request
# into eight 128 KiB commands; at 1 MiB it sends one, and because the bdev sets
# split_on_optimal_io_boundary with a 1 MiB boundary, that one command lands
# inside a single chunk -- one S3 object -- rather than straddling two.
#
# Upper bound: nvmf refuses the transport outright if
# max_io_size / iobuf.large_bufsize > SPDK_NVMF_MAX_SGL_ENTRIES (tcp.c:835),
# which with the 132 KiB default large_bufsize and 16 entries allows just over

# (max_num_segments = 1, vbdev_s3lvol_lvol.c:364). The win here is on the wire and
# in chunk alignment. Collapsing it further would need either io_unit_size at
# 1 MiB -- which requires raising iobuf's large_bufsize and costs
# num_shared_buffers x 1 MiB of memory per poll group -- or multi-iovec support in
# s3_bs_dev. Neither is done here.

# iobuf: how many pieces a host I/O arrives in.
#
# The knob for this is not the transport's io_unit_size -- lib/nvmf/tcp.c does not
# reference that option at all in this version. What decides it is iobuf's buffer
# size (transport.c:209 copies it into the transport, and :922-931 does the
# arithmetic):
#
#     io_unit_size = length > small_bufsize ? large_bufsize : small_bufsize
#     num_buffers  = ceil(length / io_unit_size)
#
# With the 132 KiB default, a 1 MiB read arrives as 8 buffers, so 8 iovecs, and
# because the bdev sets max_num_segments = 1 (s3_bs_dev only accepts iovcnt == 1)
# the bdev layer splits it into 8 children -- 8 S3 object operations for one host
# I/O. Measured with bdev_get_iostat: read_ops +8. At 1 MiB it is one buffer, one
# bdev I/O, one object.
#
# The price is in that same expression: **anything larger than small_bufsize
# (8 KiB) takes a whole large buffer**. A 16 KiB read now pins 1 MiB instead of
# 132 KiB. iobuf has exactly two size classes, so this cannot be shaped further
# without moving small_bufsize up as well, which would then waste on 4 KiB I/O.
# The pool count is what bounds the total: exhausting it makes requests wait in
# iobuf (transport.c:943 passes an entry, so they queue and are retried), which
# costs latency, not correctness.
#
# 512 x 1 MiB = 512 MiB, against the 1024 x 132 KiB = 132 MiB it replaces. Keep

# Host-side baseline readahead for activated volumes, in KiB. Matches the chunk

# manifest chunks present) promote the default 1024 KiB baseline to 4096 KiB.
# Any other explicit value is kept fixed; 0 disables the tuning entirely.
#
# **Exported to the target**, which is what actually applies it: the module sets
# readahead the moment a volume resolves to a device (get_bdev_write_one), which
# is earlier than any script can manage and needs no cooperation from whoever
# activated the volume. Exporting rather than only setting is the same bargain as
# S3LVOL_ACTIVE_FILE above -- with two independent values, the two layers would
# write different numbers to the same sysfs file and silently undo each other.

# Why it is worth the attention: what a cold read costs is one S3 request, near
# enough regardless of how many bytes it asks for. Measured on this stack, at a
# queue depth of 64:

#     bs=1M     252 IOPS   251.7 MB/s
#
# Same order of requests, eight times the data. So a sequential reader that lets
# the kernel read ahead a whole chunk pays one request where it used to pay
# eight. With the kernel default of 128 KiB against a 1 MiB chunk, a single
# threaded sequential read (md5sum, tar, cp) measured 6.1 MB/s; at 1024 KiB the
# same read measured 29.4 MB/s.
#
# It also compounds with the chunk cache: a 1 MiB aligned read populates a whole
# slot in one go (s3_cache.c), so the *second* pass over the same data is served
# locally -- 481 MB/s measured, against 342 with the kernel default.
#
# The cost is read amplification on random small reads -- 4 KiB asked for, up to
# 1 MiB fetched. That is a real cost for a random-only workload; set this to 128
# for the kernel default, or 0 to leave devices strictly alone. Neither is a

#
# What hugepages buy DPDK is TLB coverage and physically contiguous memory that
# can be pinned and handed to a device for DMA. This target needs neither:
#
#   - the only local block device is bdev_aio, which reaches the disk through
#     read/write syscalls, so the kernel copies from ordinary process memory and
#     no IOVA is involved;
#   - the network side is nvmf_tcp over kernel sockets, again syscalls;
#   - S3 traffic goes through aws-c-s3, whose buffers are its own malloc'd
#     memory and never DPDK's.
#
# So nothing in this data path programs a device with a physical address, which
# is the one thing --no-huge takes away (DPDK cannot resolve IOVAs for
# non-hugepage memory, so a VFIO/uio driver -- bdev_nvme on a real PCIe SSD,
# virtio -- would not work). Adding such a bdev is the moment to revisit this.

# pools. Worth measuring before assuming it matters, and easy to switch back:

# Target process
#
# === Identified by its executable, never by its name ===
#
# SPDK renames the main thread as soon as the first reactor starts, so a live
# target's /proc/<pid>/comm reads "reactor_0" and nothing matches "s3lvol_tgt".
# Both obvious checks therefore return nothing on a running target:
#
#   pgrep -x s3lvol_tgt          -> no match
#   grep s3lvol_tgt /proc/N/comm -> no match
#
# Which is not a cosmetic problem. Written that way, the "is another target
# already running" check in rcow_start.sh silently became a no-op: measured, it
# let a second target start on top of a live one, and the newcomer took over
# /var/run/s3lvol.sock (the RPC server unlinks the path before binding), leaving the
# first process alive, holding the lvstore and the WAL image, and unreachable.
# Two targets one aio bdev apart from writing the same WAL is not a state
# anything recovers from.
#
# /proc/<pid>/exe survives the rename, so that is what is compared.
#
# With one wrinkle: the kernel appends " (deleted)" to that link once the binary
# has been replaced, which `make` does on every build. Left unhandled it makes
# the identity check fail against exactly the target this script is most likely
# to be asked to stop -- the one running the binary that was just rebuilt -- and
# a failed identity check reads as "no target is running". Measured: build,
# rcow_stop (which reported nothing running and then deleted the pidfile),
# rcow_start (whose RPC server unlinked the socket the live target was listening
# on), and the first target was left holding the lvstore and the WAL with no
# path left to reach it. The suffix is therefore stripped before comparing.
#
# And the exact comparison is not enough by itself, because an upgrade is exactly
# the case where the old binary's path stops resolving: the process was started
# from a versioned directory that is later renamed away, so readlink -f of its
# exe lands on nothing and only the kernel's " (deleted)" name is left. A
# basename sweep therefore follows the exact one. This function is the guard
# against a second target over a live WAL, and the second target most worth
# catching is the old one the upgrade means to leave behind.

# Version gate
#
# === What it guards ===
#
# A hot restart hands the same on-disk state to a different binary. The local
# superblock, WAL super and checkpoint each carry a version and each fails hard
# with -EPROTO on one they do not know, so those bumps are loud. The journal is
# the exception: it has no version field, only an op value, and a reader that
# meets an op it does not know treats it as the end of the log. For a torn tail
# that is exactly right, and for a log written by a *newer* build it is silent
# truncation of acknowledged writes.
#
# So the gate runs before the kill and refuses, rather than letting the new
# binary decide: it is the only place the two formats are both known.
#
# === Why the comparison takes two documents ===
#
# One from the running target (rcow_get_build_info) and one from the candidate
# binary (s3lvol_tgt --print-build-info). Nothing here touches the target, so
# every refusal is testable with synthetic documents and no second build tree.
#
# rcow_version_gate_compare <running-json-file> <candidate-json-file>
#
# 0 = a hot upgrade is allowed, 1 = refused, with every reason on stderr.
# spdk_version is reported and never compared: an SPDK bump moves the nvmf
# firmware revision and the default model number, and the host identifies a disk
# by namespace UUID, so drift there is expected -- refusing on it would forbid
# the cross-SPDK upgrade the design allows.

# Write the initiator timeouts onto the controllers that already exist, for an
# upgrade that is about to kill the target while leaving the connections up.
#
# === Why the write order is load-bearing ===
#
# What bounds the retry budget is not ctrl_loss_tmo's value but the count
# max_reconnects, and only the ctrl_loss_tmo store recomputes it:
#
#     opts->max_reconnects = DIV_ROUND_UP(ctrl_loss_tmo, opts->reconnect_delay);
#
# The reconnect_delay store changes the delay and leaves the count alone. So the
# delay has to be written first and the timeout second, so the recompute sees
# the new delay. The other order leaves the old count in place and collapses the
# budget -- a 1800s setting under the default 10s delay becomes 180s -- silently,
# and at exactly the moment the budget is needed. The read-back is what makes a
# wrong order observable: the ctrl_loss_tmo show method returns
# max_reconnects * reconnect_delay, so the count is visible in the value.
#
# === Why reconnect_delay is clamped to >= 1 ===
#
# Its store is kstrtou32 with no lower bound, so 0 is accepted. Zero is a
# zero-delay retry storm that spends max_reconnects in milliseconds, and it makes
# the kernel divide by zero on the next ctrl_loss_tmo write. It never reaches
# sysfs from here.
#
# Return codes: 0 tuned, 1 refused (bad input, a failed assertion, or an enabled
# fast_io_fail_tmo), 2 the kernel exports neither attribute (pre-5.7), so the
# host runs on its own default however this is configured: a rollback deadline
# derived from this system's ctrl_loss_tmo has to start from

# Re-attach every volume the previous process had exposed, at exactly the
# subsystem and nsid it was on.
#
# === Why the registry is moved aside first ===
#
# rcow_active_bdev short-circuits when the name is already in the registry: it
# reports where the volume is and attaches nothing. That is correct inside the
# process that attached it -- activation has to be idempotent, because a caller
# that timed out will retry -- and wrong for a process that has just started,
# where the entry describes a namespace that no longer exists. Replaying against
# a populated registry would therefore report every volume as restored while
# attaching none of them.
#
# So the plan is a copy and the live registry is deleted before the first
# activation call of this process. The module reads the file lazily, on the first
# activation RPC, which is what makes the ordering enough -- nothing has read it
# yet at this point.
#
# The copy is what makes the deletion safe: dying between the two leaves the plan
# behind, and the next run finds it and repeats. Dying part way through leaves
# the plan holding what is left.
#
# === Why the activation calls are batched ===
#
# One rcow_active_bdev per volume is one python interpreter and one round-trip
# per volume, all inside the pause window. rcow_active_bdev_batch restores them
# in a single round-trip. It does
# not shorten any one namespace's pause: the nvmf pause names a single nsid, so
# each volume is added under its own pause and volumes on one subsystem pay one
# pause each. Only the round-trip is saved.
#
# The batch is not transactional -- earlier successes stay and the failures are
# named. That is deliberate: the caller's retry is idempotent, and rolling a
# successful attach back would be worse.

# Every recorded volume has to resolve to a block device that can actually be
# opened. An entry that does not is the failure this whole mechanism exists to
# prevent: the registry says the volume is exposed and the host cannot see it.
#
# === Why the path is tested with -b and not merely for being non-empty ===
#
# The path is not stored or predicted; the module looks it up by matching the lvol
# uuid against the namespace uuid in sysfs (vbdev_s3lvol_active.c). So a non-empty
# answer means *sysfs* has the namespace -- and the device node under /dev is
# created afterwards, by udev. The gap between the two is small and easy to miss:
# it took running the whole test suite back to back, on a busier machine than a
# single run leaves behind, for a dd to hit "No such file or directory" on a path
# this function had just declared present.
#
# Which matters beyond the tests, because rcow_start.sh calls this after a replay
# and logs "all N active volume(s) resolve to a block device" on the strength of
# it. Anything reading that line and opening the device would race udev.
#
# With --expect the same poll is a precondition rather than the answer: once the
# devices exist, the live layout is compared byte for byte against the snapshot
# rcow_upgrade.sh took before the upgrade. The upgrade is only allowed to be
# invisible, so a volume that moved subsystem, changed nsid, came back under a
# different device node, or gained company is as much a failure as one that did
# not come back at all -- which is why an extra live entry fails too.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Resolving the lvstore name
#
# Placed at the very bottom because it needs rcow_bstore_entry() and the logging
# helpers; the variable itself is declared up with the rest of the configuration.
#
# Why per-node at all: the name is the key prefix (see the comment at the
# declaration), so nodes sharing a bucket must not share a name. Nothing in the
# module enforces that -- the owner marker under `<prefix>/meta/owner` catches the
# cases that happen one after another (a second node attaching while the first
# holds it, or after the first crashed), but s3_owner.h is explicit that it cannot
# catch two nodes acquiring at the same time, and a clean shutdown *releases* the
# marker, so it is not there to catch a same-named node starting later. Per §1.3 of
# the design doc, single-writer is an upper-layer guarantee. This is that layer
# doing its part.
#
# A truncated digest of the identity hostname is what makes it per-node: stable
# across reboots, needs no coordination, and does not leak the hostname into
# bucket keys. DNS names still use hostname -s (the label before the first
# dot) so an existing one-click prefix survives a domain-suffix change.
# Addresses and dotted hostnames with a numeric short name (192.0.2.48,
# 192.0.2.48.internal -> short name "192", one prefix per /8) hash in full.
#
# On collisions, honestly: 4 bytes is 32 bits, so for N nodes in one bucket the
# birthday probability is roughly N^2 / 2^33 -- about 1 in 8600 at a thousand
# nodes, and about 1.2% at ten thousand. That is not negligible at scale, and a
# collision is exactly the corruption described above. Two things to know:
#
#   - it is not silent if the colliding node is the *second* one to start, because
#     the owner marker is present and attach refuses with -EBUSY;
#   - it *is* silent when the first node is cleanly stopped and the second starts
#     afterwards with no bstore.json entry of its own, which is the create path.
#     Closing that needs a "is this prefix empty" check before create; it is not
#     implemented, and widening the hash does not substitute for it.
#
# Use RCOW_LVS_NAME to pin a name from the orchestrator if you have real node ids;
# a name you assign beats a hash of a hostname you happen to have.
