#  rcow_start.sh -- bring the rcow data plane up
#
#  Order of operations, and why it is this order:
#
#    1. target process               nothing else can be configured without it
#    2. TCP transport + subsystems   a subsystem's max_namespaces is fixed at
#                                    creation, so the grid is built up front --
#                                    but without listeners; see step 7
#    3. WAL bdev                     the lvstore attach needs it by name
#    4. S3 namespaces                the lvstore attach resolves its namespace
#                                    through them
#    5. lvstore: attach or create    see below
#    6. replay the active registry   volumes come back where they were
#    7. listeners, then nvme connect the host's first look at a subsystem finds
#                                    it already complete
#
#  Step 5 is the one with teeth. /data/cubelet/rcow/bstore.json records every
#  lvstore that
#  exists; an entry for ours means attach, no entry means create. Nothing else is
#  allowed to influence that choice -- in particular a failed attach never falls
#  back to create, because create formats the journal and the WAL, and after a
#  crash those hold the only copy of writes already acknowledged to the host. An
#  attach that fails is an incident to look at, not a condition to work around.
#
#  Step 6 is what makes a restart invisible to the layer above: the namespaces
#  come back on the same subsystem and nsid they were on, so the host's uuid ->
#  device lookup keeps working. See rcow_replay_registry() in rcow_common.sh for
#  why the registry has to be moved aside before the first activation call.
#
#  Step 7 is last on purpose. A subsystem becomes reachable the moment it has a
#  listener, and the host names its devices from what it finds at that moment --
#  the Y in /dev/nvmeXnY is allocated on discovery, not taken from the nsid. Open
#  the listeners before the replay and the host attaches to empty subsystems and
#  then picks the namespaces up an AEN at a time; open them after and its first
#  scan sees the finished layout. Doing it after is also what makes a recovery
#  follow the same sequence as a fresh start, which is what keeps a volume on the
#  device name it had. See rcow_add_listeners().
#
#  Usage:
#    rcow_start.sh [--no-create] [--no-connect] [--no-replay] [--force]
#                  [--no-auto-force] [--lvs-name NAME]
#
#      --no-create    fail instead of creating an lvstore when none is recorded.
#                     For a node that is only ever supposed to attach one.
#      --no-connect   leave the initiator side alone (target-only bring-up).
#      --no-replay    do not restore previously active volumes. The registry is
#                     left untouched, so a later rcow_recovery.sh still can.
#      --force        take the lvstore over even if S3 says somebody else holds
#                     it. Only when you know the holder is gone: if it is not,
#                     two processes end up writing the same objects.
#      --no-auto-force
#                     do not take it over even when the marker can be proved
#                     stale (this node's own dead pid). Every crash then needs an
#                     operator to pass --force.
#
#  Everything else is configured through the environment; see rcow_common.sh.
