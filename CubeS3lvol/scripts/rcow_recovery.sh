#  rcow_recovery.sh -- make the running data plane match the recorded layout
#
#  There are three situations this has to tell apart, and only one of them is a
#  recovery in the interesting sense.
#
#  1. The target is not running.
#
#     Then the recovery *is* a start: the journal has to be replayed, the WAL
#     drained and the namespaces re-attached, in that order, and rcow_start.sh
#     already does all of it. So this hands over rather than reimplementing a
#     second bring-up path that would drift from the first.
#
#  2. The target is running and a replay plan is left over.
#
#     A previous replay died part way through. Resuming is safe, and safe for a
#     specific reason: the plan is consulted only after the live registry has
#     been removed, so the entries still in the plan are exactly the ones this
#     process has not attached. Volumes already restored are in the live registry
#     and in this process's memory, which is what rcow_active_bdev's idempotent
#     branch is for.
#
#  3. The target is running with no plan outstanding.
#
#     Then there is nothing to replay, and the only useful thing to do is check
#     that the claim the registry makes is true -- that every volume it lists is
#     visible to the host. A verification, not a repair.
#
#  === Why case 3 does not attempt a repair ===
#
#  The mismatch means the registry was loaded by a process that never attached
#  those namespaces, so every entry in it is a plan rather than a fact. Attaching
#  them from here would work -- rcow_active_bdev attaches a recorded volume it
#  finds unattached -- but a restart replays the whole recorded layout from a
#  copy, and case 1 already does that properly. Repairing a subset out of a
#  verify-or-restart path would report a layout restored in part, and reporting a
#  layout that is not there is the one failure this mechanism exists to prevent.
#  Draining the WAL is part of it too, and that is a start, not an attach.
#
#  Usage: rcow_recovery.sh [--verify-only] [--timeout SEC]
#
#    --verify-only  never start anything and never attach anything; just report.
#                   Suitable for a health check.
#    --timeout SEC  how long to wait for the host to publish devices (default 60).
