#  One JSON-RPC call to a running s3lvol target.
#
#  === Why not spdk/scripts/rpc.py ===
#
#  rpc.py only knows the methods it has Python wrappers for. The s3lvol methods
#  (rcow_create_lvstore, rcow_attach_lvstore, rcow_checkpoint_lvstore, ...) live
#  in this repo, not in SPDK, so rpc.py rejects them outright. Every test script
#  therefore needs a way to send a raw request, and this is it -- previously
#  copied into each script, which is how the two copies drifted to different
#  socket timeouts.
#
#  Also useful by hand when reproducing a failure against a target that a test
#  left running:
#
#    test/tools/s3lvol_rpc.py rcow_get_lvstores
#    test/tools/s3lvol_rpc.py rcow_checkpoint_lvstore '{"lvs_name":"dpvs"}'
#
#  === Output contract, relied on by the shell callers ===
#
#    success -> the "result" member, as JSON, on stdout; exit 0
#    error   -> the "error" member, as JSON, on stderr; exit 1
#
#  So `out=$(s3lvol_rpc.py ...) || handle_failure` works, and a failed call never
#  puts anything on stdout that a caller could mistake for a result.
#
#  === The {bool_value, string_value} envelope ===
#
#  Every RPC an external caller uses answers with the same two fields, whether it
#  worked or not (see the header of vbdev_s3lvol_rpc.c):
#
#    {"bool_value": true,  "string_value": "vol0"}
#    {"bool_value": false, "string_value": "lvol 'vol0' not found"}
#
#  Both are JSON-RPC *successes*, so the transport no longer distinguishes them
#  and the contract above would report every failure as exit 0. This unwraps the
#  envelope instead:
#
#    bool_value true  -> string_value on stdout, exit 0
#    bool_value false -> string_value on stderr, exit 1
#
#  which restores the contract, and does it in one place rather than in each of
#  the ~200 call sites across the test suite and scripts/.
#
#  Printing string_value *verbatim* is what makes the unwrapping transparent: the
#  RPCs with more than a name to report put a serialised JSON document in there
#  (rcow_get_bdev, rcow_get_decouple, rcow_get_exports, rcow_get_imports, rcow_active_bdev), so
#  stdout ends up carrying exactly the object or array those RPCs used to return,
#  and callers that parse it need no change at all.
#
#  --raw turns this off, which is what to use when the question is what the target
#  actually put on the wire.
#
#  === Retrying failed snapshot deletes: --retry-pending ===
#
#  Deleting a snapshot that is pinned (an export names it, it has clones, or a
#  decouple is running) is refused, and the refusal records a pending-delete
#  mark for the snapshot. The mark is the *only* record that a delete was asked
#  for: from the target's side every delete arrives as the same RPC, so there
#  is no way to tell a user's delete from an automation's. The mark therefore
#  is what "the user asked for this delete" means.
#
#    test/tools/s3lvol_rpc.py --retry-pending
#
#  reads rcow_get_lvstores, finds every snapshot that carries the mark AND has
#  become deletable since the refusal (deletable is YES), and calls
#  rcow_delete_lvol for each, passing the snapshot's uuid along with its name.
#  A snapshot without the mark is never touched, so snapshots a test or another
#  node created, or that were never deleted on purpose, are left alone. Each
#  successful delete clears the mark on the target; a delete that is refused
#  again is reported and does not stop the others. Exit status is 0 only if
#  every marked-and-deletable snapshot went.
#
#  A ~60s poller already completes leased exports, extra clones, and finished
#  decouples. This command is for lease-less exports, failed destroys, and not
#  waiting out the poller. Marks are persisted to
#  <prefix>/meta/pending-deletes.json; a crash before that PUT forgets the
#  intent. Withdraw a mark with rcow_cancel_pending_delete (idempotent;
#  lvol_name required, lvs_name optional). If the poller has already submitted
#  destroy, cancel only drops the mark and the snapshot may still go away.
#
#    * The cluster deployment does not run this: Cubelet's own delete path
#      (S3Cow.DeleteByKind) still treats a refused snapshot delete as success.
#      This is an operator tool for the node, not a fix for that.
