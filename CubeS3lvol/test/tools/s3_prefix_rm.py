#  Delete every object under a prefix, or just list them.
#
#  === Why this exists at all ===
#
#  Nothing in s3lvol deletes an lvstore's objects: rcow_unload_lvstore
#  keeps them on purpose, since the next attach needs them. So every test run
#  leaves a prefix behind, and a crashed run also leaves an owner marker that
#  makes the *next* create fail with -EBUSY until it is removed. That turns
#  cleaning the bucket into a routine step rather than an occasional chore.
#
#  === Why it signs requests by hand ===
#
#  No aws-cli and no boto3 on the test hosts, and installing them is not always an
#  option. The target's own S3 client cannot be used either: cleaning up after a
#  crashed process is exactly the case where no target is running. Everything here
#  is stdlib.
#
#  === Usage ===
#
#    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
#    test/tools/s3_prefix_rm.py -e cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com \
#                               -b my-bucket -r ap-nanjing -p dpvs/
#    test/tools/s3_prefix_rm.py ... --list          # show, delete nothing
#    test/tools/s3_prefix_rm.py ... -p ''           # the whole bucket
#
#  An empty prefix is allowed and means the entire bucket, so point it only at a
#  bucket dedicated to testing.
