#
#  === What is worth asserting here ===
#
#  Every other dataplane test drives the target directly. This one drives the
#  three scripts, because their job is the sequencing, and the failures that
#  matter are the ones where a script reports success for a state that is not
#  there:
#
#    1. create vs. attach is decided from bstore.json, and a second start must
#       attach rather than create -- create formats the journal and the WAL.
#    2. a restart puts every volume back on the same subsystem and nsid, and the
#       data is still there. The host's uuid -> device lookup depends on it.
#    3. after a crash the owner marker in S3 blocks the attach. Forcing past it is
#       only allowed once the holder is proved dead, and "proved" has to mean
#       something narrower than "the attach failed".
#    4. a registry entry naming a volume that no longer exists is dropped, loudly,
#       rather than replayed onto whatever now answers to that name.
#    5. a target that loaded the registry but attached nothing must be reported as
#       a mismatch, not as healthy.
#
#  Case 5 is also the regression guard for a NULL dereference that killed the
#  target on the first rcow_get_bdev after a restart: spdk_json_next() returns
#  NULL at the end of the enclosing object, and the registry loader walked past
#  it. Nothing else in the suite reaches that line, because every other test
#  either starts with no registry file or removes it before the first activation.
#
#  === Isolation ===
#
#  The lvstore name, the WAL image and the run directory are all test-specific, so
#  a production instance is untouched. bstore.json and rcow_active_lvols are not:
#  their paths are compiled into the module. So the test refuses to run when
#  something is already recorded as active, and removes only its own entries
#  afterwards.
#
#  Usage:
#    sudo -E ./test/dataplane/run_control_test.sh
#
#  Needs root (the target, nvme connect) and a readable /data/cubelet/s3.cfg.
