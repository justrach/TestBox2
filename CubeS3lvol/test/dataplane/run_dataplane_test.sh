# Data-plane verification for the s3lvol vbdev (HANDOFF 7.3b).
#
# === What this checks ===
#
# Everything up to now only exercised the control plane: the nvmf loopback was
# brought up and /dev/nvmeXnY appeared, but no byte was ever pushed through it
# (HANDOFF 5.16). This script closes that gap, end to end:
#
#   s3lvol_tgt -> lvstore on S3 -> lvol -> bdev -> nvmf tcp -> kernel nvme
#   -> /dev/nvmeXnY -> dd / fio
#
# The lvstore is created *with a local device* (a sparse file behind bdev_aio),
# which is what selects the WAL write path: writes are logged and acknowledged
# locally, and a background flusher turns them into S3 objects one
# read-modify-write per chunk. Without that the target falls back to writing
# straight to S3, which loses concurrent partial-chunk writes -- so step 5b
# asserts the WAL path really is active instead of assuming it.
#
# The specific things it is meant to catch:
#
#  1. Whether written data reads back byte for byte (dd + sha256, and fio's own
#     verify).
#  2. Whether max_num_segments = 1 actually takes effect. The bs_dev refuses
#     iovcnt > 1 with -ENOTSUP, so if the bdev layer is not splitting, an fio
#     run with iodepth > 1 and large blocks will surface it. The log is grepped
#     for that message afterwards -- an I/O error alone would not tell us which
#     of the two layers was at fault.
#  3. Whether reads of never-written regions return zeroes, which is what
#     blobstore assumes for unallocated chunks.
#  4. Whether concurrent writes into one chunk survive. This is the defect the
#     WAL and the flusher exist to fix (HANDOFF 7.3b-BLOCKER): the fio job in
#     step 8 uses 1 MiB blocks at iodepth 8, which nvmf splits into eight
#     concurrent commands landing in the same chunk.
#  5. Whether the shutdown ordering is right (step 10). Unloading has to drain
#     the flusher, let blobstore write its final metadata, flush that too, close
#     the log, and only then release the journal and the local device. Getting
#     that wrong shows up as an assert or a hang, and nowhere else.
#  6. Whether dest cache plus overlay stay consistent (step 7b). After step 7
#     the first 16 MiB is in dest cache; a 4 KiB overwrite in one of those
#     chunks must read back as overlay-merged data, and a neighbouring clean
#     chunk must still be served from dest cache.
#
# === Why the checks are structured this way ===
#
# Reading back through the same /dev node right after writing proves little on
# its own: the page cache would serve the data even if S3 held garbage. So every
# read that matters uses iflag=direct.
#
# On the WAL path that is no longer enough either -- reads consult the in-process
# overlay first, so disconnecting nvme does not prove the data left the process.
# Step 6b therefore flushes the lvstore, which empties the overlay, and only then
# does step 7 disconnect, reconnect and re-read. At that point the data can only
# have come from S3. Step 7b then dirties one of those dest-cached chunks and
# reads it back without flushing, which is the window dest cache would get
# wrong if it served the old dest object.
#
# Usage:
#   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
#   sudo -E ./test/dataplane/run_dataplane_test.sh \
#            -e cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com -b my-bucket -r ap-nanjing
#
# Needs root: nvme connect and /dev access.

#
# s3_ctx and the chunk map are single-owner-thread with no locking, but blobstore
# calls bs_dev entry points from whatever thread holds the channel, and nvmf runs
# I/O on a dedicated poll group thread -- it creates one per core with its own
# spdk_thread (spdk/module/event/subsystems/nvmf/nvmf_tgt.c:226), which is never
# the thread that created the lvstore.
#
# Note that reactor count is irrelevant to that mismatch: one reactor can host
# many spdk_threads, so even -m 0x1 hits it. s3_bs_dev therefore bounces work to
# the owner thread and bounces the completion back. Using two reactors here
# exercises that path rather than hiding it.
