#  T1 -- I/O continuity across a hot upgrade.
#
#  === What this proves, and why fio is the whole point ===
#
#  The claim under test is not "the upgrade finished" but "I/O never failed":
#  the host's block requests are paused while the target is replaced and then
#  complete on the *same* /dev/nvmeXnY, with no error and no sandbox teardown.
#  A run in which fio errored and the upgrade still "succeeded" must be red, so
#  every fio process is started before the upgrade and read back after it, and
#  err / io_errors are asserted per volume rather than summed into one number.
#
#  The mechanism is the one already proven by crash recovery: do not disconnect,
#  do not unload. rcow_upgrade.sh flushes and checkpoints online, then SIGKILLs
#  the target; rcow_start.sh rebuilds the same NQN/NSID/UUID grid and the kernel
#  reconnects. Anything that disconnects or unloads instead deletes the
#  namespace and the host tears the gendisk down -- which is the EIO this suite
#  exists to catch, so a failure here is a design violation, not a flake.
#
#  === What the pause window means, and what is printed ===
#
#  pause_window_ms is measured from just before rcow_upgrade.sh to after the
#  layout is verified live again. That deliberately *over*-states the true pause:
#  the online flush and checkpoint happen inside it but block nothing. It is an
#  upper bound, and a regression baseline -- a number that only grows is the
#  signal to look, not a pass/fail gate.
#
#  === The cross-SPDK case is not optional coverage ===
#
#  A hot upgrade across SPDK versions is allowed only if the nvmf model is
#  pinned (-d in rcow_create_subsystems) and there is a real test for
#  it. Same-binary self-upgrade cannot observe a firmware-revision change, so
#  --cross-spdk runs a second upgrade whose *new* binary comes from a second
#  build tree. Without the flag a SKIP is printed -- never silence, because a
#  silent fall-back to "same binary again" would look like coverage it is not.
#
#  Usage:
#    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
#    sudo -E ./test/dataplane/run_hot_upgrade_test.sh \
#             -e cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com -b my-bucket -r ap-nanjing \
#             [--volumes N] [--cross-spdk /path/to/other/tree]
#
#  Needs root (nvme connect, /dev access), fio, and exclusive use of this
#  machine's nvme stack -- it connects all 32 controllers and owns the fixed RPC
#  socket, so it must not run concurrently with anything else.
