#  A real filesystem on an activated volume, and snapshots of it.
#
#  === Why this suite exists, when run_snapshot_test.sh already covers snapshots ===
#
#  Everything else in test/dataplane reaches the volume with dd, fio or
#  blkdiscard: aligned, direct, one pattern at a known offset. A filesystem does
#  none of that. mkfs and mount issue small unaligned metadata writes, hundreds of
#  segments per request, and -- the part that turned out to matter -- an NVMe FLUSH
#  per journal commit.
#
#  That last one is not hypothetical. The first version of this stack implemented
#  SPDK_BDEV_IO_TYPE_FLUSH as spdk_blob_sync_md(), a blobstore *metadata*
#  operation, which blobstore asserts is only ever issued on its md_thread. A
#  FLUSH arrives on whichever nvmf poll group owns the qpair, never that thread,
#  so the target died the moment a host ran mkfs.xfs:
#
#      blob_verify_md_op: Assertion
#      `spdk_get_thread() == blob->bs->md_thread' failed.
#
#  Fifteen suites and 643 assertions passed over that bug, because not one of them
#  ever asked the volume to behave like a disk. This one does, and step [12] greps
#  for that assertion by name.
#
#  === What is actually asserted ===
#
#  The load-bearing claim is at file granularity, not block granularity:
#
#    a snapshot taken of a quiesced filesystem, mounted read-only elsewhere,
#    contains exactly the files the origin held at the moment it was taken --
#    same set, same contents -- and none of the changes made afterwards.
#
#  "Exactly" is a diff of two manifests (every file's md5, sorted), not a spot
#  check, and the manifest is asserted to be non-trivial first: comparing two
#  empty listings succeeds and proves nothing.
#
#  === Mounting a snapshot: what the host has to do. Measured, not assumed ===
#
#  This is the operational finding the suite exists to record, and the first two
#  versions of it guessed wrong.
#
#  A snapshot refuses writes at the bdev layer, but nvmf has no way to say so:
#  there is no write-protect bit in the namespace it reports (the note in
#  vbdev_s3lvol_lvol.c explains why, and run_snapshot_test.sh step [8] pins
#  blockdev --getro at 0 so that it breaks loudly if that ever changes). The host
#  therefore believes a snapshot is an ordinary writable disk.
#
#  XFS decides whether it may write during mount by asking the *block device*:
#  xlog_find_tail() calls xlog_clear_stale_blocks(), which writes, and skips it
#  only when xfs_readonly_buftarg() is true. With the host's flag at 0 that write
#  is attempted, the bdev rejects it, and the mount dies of an EIO that mount(8)
#  reports as the thoroughly misleading "can't read superblock":
#
#      XFS (nvme17n1): log recovery write I/O error at daddr 0x28 len 4096 error -5
#      XFS (nvme17n1): failed to locate log tail
#
#  The "recovery" there is not recovery of anything -- it happens with a perfectly
#  clean log, which is what took two attempts to work out.
#
#  blockdev --setro on the host is what closes the gap, and then XFS behaves:
#
#    snapshot taken of        --setro?  mount -o ro,nouuid
#    -----------------------  --------  -----------------------------------------
#    an unmounted filesystem  no        EIO, "can't read superblock"
#    an unmounted filesystem  yes       mounts, "Ending clean mount"
#    a frozen mounted fs      yes       refused honestly -- "recovery required on
#                                       read-only device, write access
#                                       unavailable"; takes -o norecovery
#
#  So: always --setro a snapshot before mounting it, and add -o norecovery when the
#  snapshot was taken of a live filesystem, because xfs_freeze does not cover the
#  log (xfs_quiesce_attr() forces the log and reclaims inodes; it writes no unmount
#  record) and a read-only device cannot replay one.
#
#  Steps [8] and [10] assert every row of that table, the two refusals included. A
#  refusal asserted without its reason is worth nothing -- any unrelated breakage
#  also fails to mount -- so each is matched against the specific kernel message.
#
#  nouuid throughout: a snapshot carries its origin's filesystem UUID, and XFS
#  refuses to mount a duplicate while the origin is mounted.
#
#  === Isolation ===
#
#  Own lvstore name, own WAL image, own run directory, so a production instance is
#  untouched. /data/cubelet/rcow/bstore.json and
#  /data/cubelet/rcow/active_lvols are shared
#  regardless -- their paths are compiled into the module (vbdev_s3lvol_active.c,
#  vbdev_s3lvol_bstore.c) -- so the test refuses to run when anything is already
#  recorded as active, and removes only its own entries.
#
#  dmesg gets I/O errors from steps [8] and [10] on purpose, the same way
#  run_snapshot_test.sh does when it proves a snapshot rejects writes.
#
#  Usage:
#    sudo -E ./test/dataplane/run_fs_test.sh
#
#  Needs root (target, nvme connect, mount), a readable /data/cubelet/s3.cfg,
#  nvme-cli and xfsprogs.
