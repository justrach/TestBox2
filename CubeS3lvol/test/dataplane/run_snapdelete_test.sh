#
#  Deleting a snapshot while the volume it was taken from is still alive.
#
#  === What this is about ===
#
#  Every snapshot of a live volume has exactly one clone: taking a snapshot turns
#  the origin blob into a clone of the new snapshot, and taking another inserts
#  itself into that chain. So for a volume L with snapshots s0, s1, s2 taken in
#  order, the chain is
#
#      s0 <- s1 <- s2 <- L        (each arrow: "is the parent of")
#
#  and every one of s0, s1, s2 has a clone_count of exactly 1.
#
#  blobstore supports deleting such a snapshot. bs_is_blob_deletable()
#  (blobstore.c:8714) refuses unconditionally only above one clone; at exactly one
#  it sets *update_clone and merges the snapshot into its clone, and
#  spdk_lvol_destroy() cooperates by resolving that clone's lvol first (lvol.c:1584)
#  so it can be fixed up afterwards.
#
#  A pre-flight check in s3lvol_lvol_destroy() used to refuse at clone_count > 0,
#  which rejected exactly what the layers below implement. The visible effect was
#  that no snapshot could be deleted until the volume itself was gone, so a chain of
#  N snapshots could only be dismantled from the leaf end -- each delete freeing the
#  next. This suite exists because that was measured as EBUSY on a perfectly
#  ordinary "delete an old snapshot" and mistaken for a blobstore property.
#
#  === Why the assertions are about data, not return codes ===
#
#  The delete is a *merge*: the snapshot's clusters have to end up owned by its
#  clone, and the clone's own writes must win where both have a cluster. A delete
#  that returns 0 and silently loses the merged clusters would pass any check that
#  only looks at status, and would show up much later as a volume reading zeroes
#  where it used to read data. So each step here writes a distinguishable pattern,
#  and after every delete the volume is re-read and compared against what it must
#  contain.
#
#  The layout is chosen so that a wrong merge cannot look right. The volume is
#  divided into four 4 MiB regions:
#
#      region 0: written before s0, never touched again  -> lives only in s0
#      region 1: written between s0 and s1               -> lives only in s1
#      region 2: written between s1 and s2               -> lives only in s2
#      region 3: written after s2                        -> lives only in L
#
#  Reading L must always return all four, whichever snapshots have been deleted:
#  region 0 can only be reached by walking the whole chain, so if a merge drops
#  clusters it is region 0 or 1 that breaks, not the ones L wrote itself.
#
#  Usage:
#    sudo -E ./test/dataplane/run_snapdelete_test.sh
#
#  Needs root, a readable /data/cubelet/s3.cfg and nvme-cli. Uses its own lvstore,
#  WAL image and registries, so a production instance is untouched.
