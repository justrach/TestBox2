#  T2 -- faults injected into the hot-upgrade path.
#
#  === Why a separate suite from T1 ===
#
#  T1 proves the happy path keeps I/O alive. That is the least interesting half:
#  the design's real claim is that every way the upgrade can go wrong is either
#  *prevented* (the version gate, the instance guard, the timeout clamps) or at
#  least *detectable* before it becomes silent corruption. A suite that only runs
#  the happy path cannot refute that -- and the failure this feature exists to
#  prevent (a namespace removed under a live sandbox, or a journal silently
#  truncated by a newer writer) is exactly the kind that leaves a green run
#  behind.
#
#  Each scenario is a function and reports its assertions on its own. They share
#  one target because the data plane allows only one; so they are ordered to keep
#  the machine in a known state, and every scenario that shortens a kernel
#  timeout or kills the target restores it before returning. The destructive
#  scenario (past ctrl_loss_tmo) runs last among the ones that touch the machine,
#  for that reason; the static read of the stop script that follows it needs
#  nothing from the machine.
#
#  === The version gate has one home ===
#
#  These scenarios call the shipped comparison (rcow_version_gate_compare)
#  instead of restating its rule, so the rule cannot hold here and drift there.
#  The documents are the real ones -- the running target's rcow_get_build_info
#  against the candidate's `s3lvol_tgt --print-build-info` -- and each refusal is
#  provoked by mutating a copy of a document, so no second build tree is needed.
#  The last gate case runs the refusal through `rcow_upgrade.sh --candidate`,
#  the entry point that ships today, and asserts the target survived it.
#
#  === The wrong write order cannot be injected through rcow_tune_initiator_timeouts ===
#
#  The function always writes reconnect_delay before ctrl_loss_tmo, so it cannot
#  produce the wrong order itself. The wrong order is therefore written to sysfs
#  directly, on this suite's own controllers, and the assertion is that the
#  read-back *detector* (ctrl_loss_tmo shows max_reconnects * reconnect_delay)
#  sees the collapse. Then the function is used to restore, which is also the
#  positive control: the correct order reads back as expected.
#
#  Usage:
#    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
#    sudo -E ./test/dataplane/run_hot_upgrade_negative_test.sh \
#             -e cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com -b my-bucket -r ap-nanjing
#
#  Needs root, nvme-cli, fio (for the I/O-does-not-notice assertions) and
#  exclusive use of this machine's nvme stack.
