#  Importing an export that came from this same lvstore.
#
#  === Why this degenerates, and why here rather than in export ===
#
#  Exporting a snapshot and importing it back into the same lvstore is a normal way
#  to get a writable copy of that snapshot -- the same API serves that and a
#  cross-node handoff. Built as an esnap clone it is both slower and more fragile
#  than it needs to be:
#
#    - a same-bucket export is REF layout by default, so the manifest references the
#      source's *live* chunk objects rather than copies. Measured: a self-import
#      built that way stops reading after the lvstore is unloaded and attached
#      again, with `<prefix>/data/<uuid>` returning 404 while the exported snapshot
#      is still present. Step [6] pins that a local clone does not have this
#      problem, which is the whole point.
#    - an esnap clone depends on a distributed export lease. A local clone's parent
#      is pinned directly by blobstore. The local path is the safer one.
#
#  The decision cannot be made when the export is written: whether a manifest will
#  be consumed here or on another node is the caller's business and unknowable at
#  that point. So export_snapshot is untouched and the import decides, where the
#  answer is observable.
#
#  === What is actually asserted ===
#
#  Besides the positive local-clone path, steps [3]-[5] assert the lifecycle
#  invariant: deleting a source snapshot revokes its ref export, and reusing that
#  snapshot name for another blob or writable lvol does not revive the export.
#
#  Usage:
#    sudo -E ./test/dataplane/run_selfimport_test.sh
#
#  Needs root, a readable /data/cubelet/s3.cfg, and nvme-cli.
