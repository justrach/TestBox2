#  Export / import across lvstores, end to end against real S3 (§11.7, HANDOFF 7.9)
#
#  === What this test is actually for ===
#
#  Pausing a sandbox on one node and resuming it on another. The two lvstores here
#  live in one process -- one target, two prefixes in one bucket, a local device
#  each -- because what has to be proved is that the *only* thing they share is
#  S3, and that is already true of two prefixes. Running two targets would test
#  the same code paths and add a second thing that can go wrong.
#
#  The load-bearing assertions, in the order they matter:
#
#    1. an imported volume reads what the exported one held. Everything else can
#       succeed while this fails: a manifest that parses, a clone that appears, a
#       bdev of the right size -- and zeroes inside.
#    2. writing the imported volume does not touch the source. It reads through to
#       the export, so a copy-on-write that went the wrong way would corrupt a
#       snapshot on the other node.
#    3. *the import survives a restart of the destination lvstore.* blobstore
#       persists the esnap id in the clone's metadata and demands the parent back
#       synchronously on every load; if the imports registry were not written, or
#       not read before spdk_lvs_load_ext(), this is where it shows -- either the
#       lvstore fails to load or the clone reads as zeroes.
#    4. after inflating, the export can be released and the volume still reads
#       correctly. That is the whole point of inflating, and the only proof that
#       the dependency is really gone rather than merely unused.
#
#  Requires: root, nvme-cli, a real bucket with credentials in the environment.

# [11d] default decouple, idempotent export, snapshot-bound lifetime
#
# Three behaviours the suite did not cover:
#
#   1. an import that does not pass decouple at all. The RPC has defaulted it to
#      true since the "xfer: decouple imported volumes by default" change, so
#      the volume must end up decoupled without anybody asking -- the flag-less
#      call is now the common case, and only the explicit decouple:true and
#      decouple:false forms were being exercised.
#
#   2. exporting the same snapshot twice always answers the same uuid: in flight
#      and after DONE. Releasing it is what allows a later export to mint a new
#      one.
#
#   3. ttl_sec is ignored: a reference export has expires_at=0 and remains DONE
#      while its snapshot exists.

# The regression this pins down, and why it was invisible for so long.
#
# write_zeroes on this device is unmap: the mapping is dropped and the object
# deleted, because a chunk with no mapping already reads back as zeroes. What it
# does *not* do is give the cluster back to blobstore -- the blob still lists it
# as allocated. So "allocated" and "has an object in S3" stop agreeing, and a
# zero-copy walk that assumes they agree finds a cluster it cannot name.
#
# The walk used to treat that as the one thing it must never ignore: data that is
# still in the WAL, where naming no object would hand the importer zeroes in
# place of real bytes. Refusing is safe but not free -- the export degrades to
# copying the whole volume. And this arrangement is not exotic: a filesystem
# produces it in bulk, since ext4's lazy inode table init zeroes megabytes of a
# freshly created volume. Every rootfs snapshot on a real node hit it, so no
# rootfs was ever handed off zero-copy, and nothing said why.
#
# Two properties are asserted, and they pull in opposite directions, which is the
# point:
#
#   1. the export stays zero-copy -- the zeroed clusters are recognised as holes
#      and skipped, rather than aborting the walk;
#   2. the imported volume still reads exactly what the source reads, zeroes
#      included. A hole absent from the manifest bitmap *is* the encoding for
#      "reads as zeroes", so getting property 1 by mislabelling live data would
#      show up here as a mismatch.
#
# blkdiscard -z is used rather than a filesystem: it issues write_zeroes at an
# offset this test chooses, so the objects that disappear are known ones rather
# than whatever ext4 happened to touch.
#
# A caveat worth writing down, because it took a probe to establish. Zeroing a
# whole cluster this way makes blobstore release it too, so those clusters are
# not reported as allocated afterwards and the walk never asks about them -- the
# skip counter can legitimately read zero here. What this step does pin down is
# the half that matters for correctness and that regressed in the field: a
# snapshot whose objects have been deleted under it still exports zero-copy, and
# still reads back exactly, zeroes and neighbours alike. The allocated-but-
# unmapped shape itself comes from a filesystem zeroing part of a cluster and is
# covered by run_agent_template_test.sh, which builds a real rootfs.

# Starting N sandboxes on a node from one sealed rootfs is the ordinary case, not
# a corner. It used to be refused outright: the imports registry is keyed by
# (lvstore, export uuid) and a second import of the same uuid was answered with
# -EEXIST.
#
# The key is right and the refusal was not. What the registry records is that this
# lvstore depends on the export -- it caches the manifest so an esnap clone can be
# reopened after a restart -- and one entry describes any number of clones. Each
# clone gets its own bs_dev from the esnap callback; all they share is a read-only
# manifest and an S3 client.
#
# What this pins down:
#
#   1. two volumes can be imported from one export, and both read what the source
#      held;
#   2. writing one does not disturb the other, nor the export. They are separate
#      copy-on-write volumes that happen to start from the same bytes;
#   3. deleting one leaves the other working -- the registry entry is shared, so a
#      delete that dropped it would break the survivor at the next attach;
#   4. release stays refused until *both* are gone, and says how many are left;
#   5. the survivor still opens after the destination lvstore is re-attached,
#      which is the only proof that the shared entry was persisted rather than

# Only one volume materialises a given export at a time. N concurrent decouples
# would fetch the same objects N times over, competing for the same client and
# bandwidth, and every one of them would finish later than if they had taken
# turns.
#
# The wait is kept inside rather than handed back as -EBUSY. "Import N volumes
# from this export and decouple them" is one operation to the caller; refusing all
# but the first would leave the rest esnap clones unless the caller noticed and
# retried, which means polling for a wait it never asked to manage.
#
# So both imports use decouple:true and both are expected to succeed. What this
# checks is that the second one really did happen -- a queue that dropped its
# entry would look identical at the RPC level and only differ in that one volume
# never became independent.
#
# The proof that it became independent is release: the export cannot be released
# while any volume still reads through it, so a release that succeeds once both
# decouples are done is the same statement as "neither reads the export any more".

# ==========================================================================
# [11h] a second decouple of the same lvstore, from a different export
#
# Step 11g covers several volumes taking turns at one *export*, which is rationed
# because they would fetch the same objects twice. Two different exports do not
# collide that way, so this is the case where the reason to wait is blobstore
# rather than S3: cluster allocation is serialised per io channel, a channel is per
# thread per blobstore, and both decouples run on the RPC thread.
#
# The bug that made this step necessary. spdk_blob_materialize_cluster() hands
# blobstore a zero-length read as the operation to re-execute once the cluster is
# in place. bs_allocate_and_copy_cluster() also queues an operation, doing nothing
# else with it, when an allocation for some other cluster is already in flight on
# the channel -- and re-executing a zero-length read copies nothing and reports
# success. So every cluster of the volume that lost the channel was counted as
# materialised without being read, and the volume was detached from an export it
# had never read: 43 clusters, 43 "materialised", 40 KiB fetched instead of 43 MiB,
# and a filesystem that would not mount.
#
# That is fixed in the API, which re-offers a cluster that lost the channel, so the
# data now arrives either way. Queueing is on top of that and is about time rather
# than correctness: with both running, those 43 clusters took 71 seconds behind 700
# instead of the 3 they take alone, the first of them losing the channel over 500
# times, and nothing was gained since blobstore serialised the work regardless.
#
# So there are two things to check and they are independent. That the second volume
# waits -- and is reported as waiting, for the lvstore rather than for the export.
# And that its data is all there afterwards, read back byte for byte, which is the
# only way to tell a materialised cluster from one that was merely counted.
#
# The first volume is deliberately larger, so that it is still copying when the
# second request arrives. It is checked too: there was never a reason to think the
# *first* one suffers, and a regression that broke it should not hide here.

# ==========================================================================
# [11i] three volumes imported concurrently from one export stay consistent
#
# 11f imported two volumes with decouple:false, one RPC after another. 11g
# queued two decouples of one export. This step is the third shape: three
# imports submitted at the same time, all decoupling from the same export, and
# the question is the data.
#
# Three kinds of stability are meant by "stable".
#
#   1. Before and after materialisation. A decoupled volume is an esnap clone
#      while its decouple runs: reads go through to the export. Once the
#      clusters are materialised, reads come from the local blob. The bytes
#      must not change across that transition. The queue from 11g guarantees
#      the transition is observable here: the first import starts decoupling
#      while the second and third are still queued, so reading them early
#      really does read an un-materialised volume, not merely a finished one.
#
#   2. Repeated reads. Reading the same volume twice must give the same bytes.
#
#   3. Independence. Copy-on-write means a write to one volume changes nothing
#      the others can see -- and their data regions must still match the
#      source afterwards.
#
# And one kind of consistency:
#
#   - All three volumes agree with each other and with the source snapshot,
#     data regions and holes alike. A hole that turns into non-zero data in
#     any of them is a materialisation bug (this is the class that used to
#     read as zeroes after d048f44).
#
# The data layout leaves a deliberate hole between the written regions, so
# that "the volume is intact" means "the written bytes are there and the
# unwritten bytes stayed zero" -- neither alone would be enough.

# so three rcow_export_snapshot calls land within milliseconds of each other.
# Nothing in the export path serialises them on purpose -- each walks its own
# snapshot and writes its own manifest -- but that is exactly why this has to
# be exercised: concurrent walks share the flusher, the chunk map and the S3
# client, and a bug there would corrupt *all three* exports at once, which a
# one-at-a-time test can never see.
#
# The step is deliberately the mirror image of 11i. There, one export and
# three concurrent imports; here, three concurrent exports and one import of
# each. The checks are the same shape -- each volume is read back byte for
# byte -- but the shared object under test is different.
#
# Three source volumes, one data region each, at different offsets so the
# exports own disjoint cluster sets (no two snapshots share a cluster, which

# destination is what breaks -- leftover registry, lease, or name -- so the
# same export is imported, read, decoupled, deleted and imported again here,
# three times. The first read deliberately warms the lvstore's exact-key object
# cache. Round one explicitly warms before decouple; later rounds use the
# production decouple=true path. Once CopyObject binds a fresh destination uuid,
# its alias must let the post-decouple first read reuse the same object slot.

# Exactly one shape of data-object 404 is benign, and every other one is a data
# integrity failure whatever else passes.
#
# The benign shape is a read that finished a step too late. create-once deletes the
# superseded object as soon as the new mapping is durable and does not wait for the
# delete, so a reader that looked its uuid up before that point can GET an object
# that existed when it started. The bs_dev recovers by looking the mapping up again
# and rereading the object it now names, and says so in the log.
#
# Everything else means the chunk map named an object that is not in S3:
#
#   a 404 with no matching reread   the mapping points at an object that is absent.
#                              Note the bs_dev turns this into -ENOENT rather than
#                              zero-filling, which is right: a committed mapping
#                              with no object is not the same as a hole, and
#                              pretending otherwise would serve zeroes for data.
#   the bs_dev declining to reread  it says why: either the mapping did not change
#                              under the read, or the object is still missing after
#                              a reread. Both mean a bad mapping, not a late read.
#   Metadata page N read failed  the same thing happening to a blobstore metadata
#                              page, i.e. to a blob's own descriptor.
#
# These were seen intermittently (2026-08-05, two runs in twelve) and survived a

# carry on and every data checksum matched. That is exactly why it has to be a hard
