#  Snapshot and clone, end to end against real S3.
#
#  === What this test is actually for ===
#
#  A snapshot is only worth anything if it stops changing. Everything else about
#  it -- that the RPC succeeds, that a bdev appears, that it reports read_only --
#  can be true while the data silently follows the origin, which would make the
#  feature worse than not having it.
#
#  So the load-bearing assertions here are the isolation ones:
#
#    - write A to the origin, snapshot it, then overwrite the origin with B:
#      the snapshot must still read A;
#    - clone the snapshot: the clone must initially read A (reads fall through to
#      the parent), and writing C to the clone must leave both the snapshot at A
#      and the origin at B.
#
#  Three volumes sharing clusters, each having to disagree with the others in the
#  right way. On this backend that is the copy-on-write path in blobstore driving
#  our bs_dev: a write to an unallocated cluster reads the whole cluster from the
#  parent and writes it to a *newly allocated* cluster, i.e. new LBAs, new chunks,
#  new UUIDs, new S3 objects. It never rewrites the parent's chunks -- verified in
#  blob_can_copy() rather than assumed, see the comment in
#  vrcow_lvstore.c. This test is what keeps that true.
#
#  Each of the three is exported as its own NVMe namespace, because reading them
#  through the guest path is the only way to check what a consumer would see.
#
#  Requires: root, nvme-cli, a real bucket with credentials in the environment.

# ==========================================================================
# [7c] discarding the clone
#
# Two questions, both of which decide whether deleting a volume can ever reclaim
# S3 space. blobstore does not clear data clusters when a blob is deleted --
# bs_release_cluster() only returns the cluster to the allocation bitmap -- so the
# proposed fix is to issue unmap over a volume before deleting it. That is only
# viable if:
#
#   1. an unmap actually reaches our bs_dev and deletes the objects, and
#   2. unmapping a clone cannot touch what its parent references.
#
# The second one is the dangerous half. A clone's unallocated clusters read
# through to the snapshot, and if an unmap followed that indirection it would
# delete objects the snapshot still needs -- corrupting a volume that is supposed
# to be immutable, from an operation on a different volume.
#
# Reading blobstore says it cannot happen: releasing a cluster requires
# blob_backed_with_zeroes_dev(), which is false for a clone, so a clone's unmap
# only reaches the device for clusters the clone itself allocated. This step is
# what turns that reading into evidence.
#
# What the clone reads afterwards is deliberately not asserted, only reported. Two
# answers are defensible -- zeroes if the cluster stays allocated with nothing
# behind it, or the parent's data if the cluster is released -- and which one
# blobstore picks is not what this test is for.
