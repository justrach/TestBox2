#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
#  run_all.sh -- every test in this tree, in one command, with an honest summary.
#
#  What made this worth writing: the suites had drifted into needing different
#  things. Ten integration tests run anywhere; two more want real S3 credentials;
#  ten dataplane scripts want root, credentials, a writable /data, and exclusive
#  use of the machine's nvme stack. Their arguments differ too -- four take
#  -e/-b/-r, six read /data/cubelet/s3.cfg themselves. So "run the tests" meant
#  remembering twenty-two invocations, and in practice meant running the two or
#  three related to whatever had just changed.
#
#  === Skipped is not passed ===
#
#  The one thing this must not do is let an unrun test look like a green one.
#  Anything that cannot run is reported as SKIP with the reason, the summary
#  counts skips separately, and the exit status is 0 only if nothing failed *and*
#  the reason for any skip was a deliberate flag rather than a broken
#  environment.
#
#  === Why serial, and why this order ===
#
#  Serial because the dataplane scripts each expect to own the machine: they
#  start a target on a fixed RPC socket, connect nvme controllers, and write
#  /data/cubelet/rcow/bstore.json and /data/cubelet/rcow/active_lvols, whose
#  paths are compiled
#  into the module and therefore shared by every instance. Two at once do not
#  fail cleanly; they interleave.
#
#  The order goes cheapest and least invasive first -- offline integration, then
#  the S3 ones, then the dataplane scripts -- so that a plain mistake surfaces in
#  seconds rather than after ten minutes of nvme traffic. activation and control
#  come last of all because they are the two most sensitive to leftover global
#  state, which makes them the best final word on whether the run left the
#  machine tidy.
#
#  === A failure does not stop the run ===
#
#  A full pass is a quarter of an hour, and stopping at the first red discards
#  everything the remaining suites would have said -- which is usually how you
#  find out whether one thing broke or ten did. Failures are collected and
#  repeated at the end.
#
#  Usage:
#    test/run_all.sh                 everything the environment allows
#    test/run_all.sh --offline       only the suites needing no S3 and no root
#    test/run_all.sh --no-dataplane  integration only, including the S3 ones
#    test/run_all.sh --list          show what would run, run nothing
#
#  Environment:
#    S3LVOL_TEST_BUCKET   override the bucket taken from s3.cfg
#    S3LVOL_SKIP_HOT_UPGRADE=1
#                         skip the two disruptive hot-upgrade suites
#    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
#                         used as-is when set; otherwise read from s3.cfg
