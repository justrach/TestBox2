 *Overlay + flusher unit test -- no S3, no credentials, no local bdev
 *
 *   === What this is actually for ===
 *
 *   The centrepiece is section [4]. It reproduces the exact shape of the
 *   data-loss bug of the direct-to-S3 path: eight concurrent 128 KiB writes
 *   landing in one 1 MiB chunk. On the old path each of them
 *   ran its own read-modify-write against a chunk that did not exist yet, so
 *   seven eighths of the data was lost and only the first 128 KiB of every
 *   megabyte survived. Here the same eight writes are accumulated in the overlay
 *   and one flush round has to produce all1 MiB, byte for byte.
 *
 *   The rest covers the properties the flush handshake depends on and that are
 *   easy to get subtly wrong: a write arriving mid-flush must not be dropped, a
 *   failed flush must lose nothing, an unmap must invalidate a flush already
 *   under way, and one chunk must never have two uploads outstanding.
 *
 *   The upload itself is faked. That is on purpose: the scheduling and
 *   bookkeeping is what has the sharp edges, and testing it without a network
 *   makes it runnable in CI. The S3 side is exercised by s3_bs_dev_test.
 *
 *   A real spdk_thread is required because the flusher registers a poller.
 *   DPDK comes up with --no-huge so no hugepages and no root are needed.
 *
 *   Usage:
 *     ./s3_flush_test
