/*
 *   Swapping the manifest under an imported export
 *
 *   === What this is for ===
 *
 *   A ref export names the *source's* live objects. When the source materialises
 *   it -- rewrites the manifest as dense, holding its own copies -- those objects
 *   stop existing, and an importer still holding the old manifest reads 404s. Its
 *   way out is to refetch and carry on against the new manifest, which is what
 *   s3_export_bs_dev_swap_manifest() does and what `generation` distinguishes.
 *   A GET that left before that swap can still 404; the refetch then sees
 *   -EALREADY, which must retry against the installed generation rather than
 *   report the snapshot as deleted.
 *
 *   === Why this needs real SPDK threads ===
 *
 *   The whole of s3_export_bs_dev.c is lock free *because* the manifest never
 *   changes: blobstore makes a channel per thread that touches the clone, and
 *   every one of them reads dev->m with no serialisation. The swap is the one
 *   operation that has to consider the others, and it does so with a grace period
 *   -- spdk_for_each_channel() -- rather than a lock.
 *
 *   A test without threads would exercise the validation and none of that. So
 *   this brings up spdk_thread and drives the iteration, which is also the only
 *   way to observe the property that matters: the old manifest is released after
 *   the grace period, not before. Checked by refcount, because "released too
 *   early" is otherwise a use-after-free that shows up somewhere else entirely.
 *
 *   No S3 and no network: swapping is pure memory. The manifests are built in
 *   process and the device never reads.
