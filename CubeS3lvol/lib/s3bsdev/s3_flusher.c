 *   s3_flusher -- drains the overlay into S3, one read-modify-write per chunk
 *
 *   === Why this fixes a correctness bug, not just a performance one ===
 *
 *   The direct-to-S3 write path ran one read-modify-write per *incoming write*.
 *   Eight concurrent 128 KiB writes into the same 1 MiB chunk therefore ran
 *   eight RMW cycles against a chunk that did not exist yet, each PUTting an
 *   object holding only its own eighth. Seven eighths of the data was lost.
 *
 *   Here the writes have already been acknowledged from the WAL and accumulated
 *   in the overlay, and the flusher runs *one* RMW per chunk with a per-chunk
 *   single-flight rule. The race is gone by construction: there is never more
 *   than one writer of a given S3 object.
 *
 *   === Division of labour ===
 *
 *   This file owns queueing, concurrency, single flight and WAL truncation. It
 *   does *not* know about S3: the actual upload is a callback supplied by
 *   s3_bs_dev, which owns the client, the key layout and the chunk map. Keeping
 *   the split means the scheduling logic can be unit tested with a fake
 *   uploader, with no credentials and no network.
 *
 *   === Threading ===
 *
 *   Owner thread only, like every other per-lvstore component. The poller is
 *   registered on the thread that calls s3_flusher_create().
