 *   s3_overlay -- RAM view of WAL-durable, not-yet-in-S3 data
 *
 *   Rationale and the flush handshake are in include/s3lvol/s3_overlay.h. Notes
 *   that only matter while reading the code:
 *
 *   1. *The chunk index is a dense pointer array*, not a hash. Same reasoning as
 *      the chunk map: chunks are fixed size so the index is plain division, and
 *      8 bytes per chunk (1 TiB of 1 MiB chunks is 8 MiB) buys O(1) lookup with
 *      no collision handling. The per-chunk struct itself is allocated lazily,
 *      so an idle overlay costs only the array.
 *   2. *Three queues.* ripe_q and aging_q together hold the chunks the flusher
 *      should pick up, split by whether the hold-back policy is still waiting on
 *      them (see below); live_q holds every chunk holding anything, and exists
 *      purely so min_seq can be computed by walking the live chunks instead of
 *      the whole address space.
 *   3. A chunk with a flush in progress is deliberately *not* on either dirty
 *      queue even when new writes have re-dirtied it. It is re-queued by
 *      flush_end. That keeps per-chunk single flight without the flusher having
 *      to skip entries it just popped.
 *
 *   === Why the dirty set is two queues and not one ===
 *
 *   It started as one FIFO ordered by the time a chunk became dirty, with
 *   next_dirty looking only at the head -- the head is the oldest, so if it is
 *   too young to flush then so is everything behind it.
 *
 *   That reasoning is sound for the age and wrong for everything else, because
 *   fullness is not ordered by dirty time. One partially dirty chunk at the head
 *   holds up every full chunk behind it, and full is the condition worth acting
 *   on: a full chunk uploads without reading the old object back first.
 *
 *   Measured, writing 32 MiB sequentially to a fresh volume: 32 chunks filled
 *   completely and became eligible immediately, and all 32 waited 45 seconds --
 *   the whole hold-back age -- behind a single chunk holding two blocks of
 *   blobstore metadata. The burst that followed was 32 "full" flushes right
 *   after the one "aged" flush that unblocked them. A filesystem writes metadata
 *   constantly and those chunks are almost never full, so the head is very often
 *   exactly this kind of blocker.
 *
 *   So chunks are kept in two queues instead: ripe_q for the ones the policy is
 *   done with, aging_q in dirty-time order for the rest. next_dirty drains
 *   ripe_q first and only then considers the age of aging_q's head. Both are
 *   still O(1) and nothing scans -- a chunk moves between them at the moment its
 *   dirty count crosses the threshold, which is already a place doing per-chunk
 *   bookkeeping.
