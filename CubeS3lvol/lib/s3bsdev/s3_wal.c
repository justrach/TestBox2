 *   s3_wal -- write-ahead log on the local bdev 
 *
 *   Design rationale, the disk format and the durability contract are in
 *   include/s3lvol/s3_wal.h. Things to keep in mind while reading this file:
 *
 *   1. *One batch in flight at a time.* Not throttling -- it keeps the log
 *      physically append-ordered, which is what lets recovery scan linearly
 *      instead of sorting by seq. It also means the batch buffer is only ever
 *      touched between batches, so it needs no double buffering.
 *   2. *A batch is durable only after write plus flush.* The two are treated as
 *      one commit unit and callers are acknowledged from the flush completion,
 *      never from the write completion. On aio the flush is fsync(); on nvme it
 *      is a Flush command.
 *   3. *seq is assigned when an op is queued*, so queue order equals seq order.
 *      Same reasoning as the journal.
 *   4. Batch atomicity comes from S3_WAL_F_LAST_IN_BATCH plus the two CRCs.
 *      Recovery accepts a batch only when it is closed and fully verified, so a
 *      torn tail is discarded whole rather than half-applied (W4).
