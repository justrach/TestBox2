 *   Export a snapshot to S3
 *
 *   Two halves, with nothing shared but the manifest:
 *
 *     1. the manifest: build, seal, serialize, parse, and the key layout
 *     2. the copy engine: read the snapshot through blobstore, upload the
 *        chunks that are not all zeroes, then upload the manifest
 *
 *   The reader lives in s3_export_bs_dev.c and only ever needs half 1.
 *
 *   === Why the manifest goes last ===
 *
 *   "The manifest exists" is the only signal an importer gets, and it has to
 *   mean "every chunk this claims is readable". So the manifest is uploaded
 *   after the last chunk PUT completes, and never before. A failed export
 *   therefore leaves no manifest at all -- the chunks that did land are
 *   unreferenced, and GC drops the prefix wholesale.
 *
 *   Note what this does *not* need: the source's chunk map, the journal, a
 *   checkpoint, or the WAL. Reads go through blobstore, so whatever combination
 *   of overlay, local log and S3 currently holds the data is its problem. The
 *   caller still has to drain before exporting, but only so that the snapshot's
 *   own metadata is durable -- not for the manifest to be valid.
