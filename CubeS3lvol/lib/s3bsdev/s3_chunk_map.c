 *   Chunk map -- maps LBA ranges to S3 objects 
 *
 *   === Choice of data structure ===
 *
 *   A dense array indexed directly by chunk_index, not an RB tree or a hash.
 *   Reasons:
 *   - Chunks are fixed size (S3_CHUNK_SIZE), so LBA -> chunk_index is plain
 *     division and no range lookup is needed at all;
 *   - blobstore I/O is extremely localized (metadata pages, sequential cluster
 *     writes), and an array's cache behaviour beats a tree's by a wide margin;
 *   - a 1 TiB lvstore with 4 MiB chunks is 256 K entries at ~56 bytes each,
 *     roughly 14 MiB, which is acceptable.
 *
 *   Sparseness is expressed by "the entry is empty" (all-zero uuid), so no
 *   separate presence structure is needed: a chunk that was never written reads
 *   back as zeroes, which is exactly the semantics blobstore expects.
 *
 *   === Two states: committed and pending ===
 *
 *   Now that insert/remove are asynchronous (memory is mutated only after the
 *   journal is durable), several operations can be in flight on the same chunk.
 *   Each entry therefore tracks two states:
 *
 *     committed -- the durable mapping. lookup() only consults this, because an
 *                  in-flight write has not completed as far as blobstore is
 *                  concerned.
 *     pending   -- "what this will become once every submitted operation has
 *                  taken effect". *Used solely to compute old_uuid and the
 *                  generation.*
 *
 *   Why pending is required: old_uuid has to be determined *at submit time* and
 *   cannot wait for the callback. Take a run of overwrites A->B->C on one chunk.
 *   If old_uuid came from committed state, both later operations would receive
 *   A -- so A gets deleted twice while B is never deleted and leaks forever.
 *   Taking it from pending yields A and then B, so every superseded object is
 *   handed back exactly once.
