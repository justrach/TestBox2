 *   Zero-copy export: describe a snapshot without reading it
 *
 *   === What this is ===
 *
 *   The whole of a cross-node handoff on the sending side, once the volume has
 *   been snapshotted and drained. It walks the snapshot's clone chain, turns each
 *   allocated cluster into the object the chunk map already has it in, and uploads
 *   one manifest naming them. No data is read; nothing is copied.
 *
 *   That is the difference between a handoff measured in round trips and one
 *   measured in gigabytes. The dense engine next door (s3_export.c) reads the
 *   snapshot and re-uploads it, which is the only option across buckets or
 *   regions, and is also what a ref export degrades into when the source
 *   eventually wants the snapshot back (see materialise, module side).
 *
 *   === The three-step translation, and where each step comes from ===
 *
 *     blob offset -> device LBA      spdk_blob_get_io_unit_lba(), which is the
 *                                    patch in patches/. Nothing else in the
 *                                    public API answers it.
 *     device LBA  -> chunk index     arithmetic, s3_lba_to_chunk_index()
 *     chunk index -> object uuid     the chunk map
 *
 *   The first step is why this file needs a patched SPDK. Reading blobstore's
 *   private cluster table would work too, right up until a field is added to
 *   struct spdk_blob and every LBA comes out wrong -- naming, with no error
 *   anywhere, objects that belong to another volume.
 *
 *   === Why a chain and not a blob ===
 *
 *   spdk_blob_get_next_allocated_io_unit() and spdk_blob_get_io_unit_lba() both
 *   read blob->active.clusters and stop there; neither follows a parent. That is
 *   exactly what this needs, but it means one blob is never the whole picture:
 *   taking a second snapshot of a volume hands the new snapshot only the clusters
 *   written since the first, because blobstore moves the cluster map across and
 *   leaves the older data in the older snapshot. So `lvol -> snap1 -> snap2`, the
 *   ordinary way to use this, produces a snap2 that owns almost nothing.
 *
 *   Hence the layers are walked nearest first, and a chunk already named is never
 *   revisited. Every layer's clusters live in the same bs_dev address space and
 *   resolve through the same chunk map, so a parent's object is not somebody
 *   else's -- it is in the same <prefix>/data/ as everything else.
 *
 *   === What the caller has to have done ===
 *
 *   Snapshotted, so the clusters cannot move; and drained, so every one of them
 *   has a committed mapping. A cluster blobstore has allocated whose data is
 *   still in the WAL has no object yet, and this refuses to continue rather than
 *   quietly leaving it out of the bitmap -- a chunk left out reads as zeroes on
 *   the importing node, which is data loss that announces itself nowhere.
 *
 *   Allocated does not imply an object, though, and the difference is not an
 *   error. write_zeroes on this device drops the mapping and deletes the object,
 *   since an unmapped chunk already reads back as zeroes -- so a cluster that
 *   was written and then zeroed stays allocated in blobstore while having
 *   nothing in S3. Filesystems do this in bulk: ext4's lazy inode table init
 *   zeroes megabytes of a freshly made volume, and every one of those clusters
 *   arrives here allocated and unmapped. Refusing them, which is what this used
 *   to do, turned an ordinary sparse snapshot into a full copy.
 *
 *   is_zeroes() separates the two, because it consults the overlay as well as
 *   the chunk map. A hole is left out of the present bitmap -- which is how
 *   the importer spells "reads as zeroes" -- and marked resolved so inherit()
 *   and older layers cannot put a parent object back. Anything else still
 *   stops the walk.
