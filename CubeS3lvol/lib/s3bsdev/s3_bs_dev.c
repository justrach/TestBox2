 *   s3_bs_dev -- lets the blobstore treat S3 as a raw disk
 *
 *   Implements struct spdk_bs_dev (spdk/blob.h); the blobstore is completely
 *   unaware of S3. Every read/write it issues is a linear LBA, including its
 *   own super block and metadata pages -- all of it goes through the same
 *   chunk -> S3 path with no special handling (P1 reuse principle).
 *
 *   === Two write paths ===
 *
 *   Which one is active depends on whether a WAL has been attached with
 *   s3_bs_dev_attach_wal().
 *
 *   *With a WAL.* A write is appended to the log, recorded in the overlay and
 *   acknowledged from there. The flusher later turns the overlay into S3
 *   objects with one read-modify-write per chunk. Reads consult the
 *   overlay first, so an acknowledged write is visible immediately even though
 *   S3 still holds the previous version.
 *
 *   *Without a WAL (direct to S3).* Every write runs its own
 *   read-modify-write straight against S3. Kept because it needs no local bdev,
 *   which is what the S3-only integration test uses, but **it is not correct
 *   under concurrency**: N concurrent writes into one chunk each read the chunk
 *   before any of them wrote it, so N-1 of them are lost. That is the defect
 *   that made the WAL path necessary. Do not use this mode for anything that
 *   matters.
 *
 *   The chunk map is persisted separately, through the metadata journal
 *   (s3_chunk_map_set_journal); without a journal it degrades to memory-only and
 *   the lvstore cannot be re-attached after a restart.
 *
 *   === Three-level mapping ===
 *
 *       LBA --shift--> chunk_index --table--> uuid --concat--> S3 key
 *
 *   Only the middle level needs a table lookup. Chunks are fixed size, so the
 *   first level is plain division.
 *
 *   === Why RMW is needed ===
 *
 *   A chunk is the granularity of an S3 object (1 MiB by default), while the
 *   blobstore issues writes far smaller than that (a metadata page is a single
 *   4 KiB block). S3 objects cannot be partially updated, so a write that does
 *   not fill a chunk must read-modify-write: GET the whole chunk -> modify in
 *   memory -> PUT a new object.
 *
 *   For small metadata writes the read-modify-write turns a 4 KiB write into a
 *   1 MiB read plus a 1 MiB write. On the WAL path that cost is paid once per
 *   chunk per flush instead of once per write, which is what removes the
 *   amplification.
 *
 *   === Thread model ===
 *
 *   One bs_dev belongs to one lvstore, and all I/O runs on its owner thread.
 *   The s3_client callbacks already bounce back to the submitting thread (see
 *   s3_client.h), so the completion logic here needs no extra locking, and
 *   neither does the chunk map.

 * === Threading ===
 *
 * blobstore may call bs_dev entry points from *any* thread holding a channel --
 * that is the whole point of create_channel/destroy_channel in the vtable. nvmf
 * in particular runs I/O on a dedicated poll group thread
 * (spdk/module/event/subsystems/nvmf/nvmf_tgt.c:226 creates one per core), which
 * is never the thread that created the lvstore.
 *
 * Most s3_ctx state is single-owner-thread, so the ordinary path is bounced
 * onto owner_thread and the completion is bounced back. Both directions are
 * mandatory there:
 *
 *   - forward, because ctx->inflight and most mutation paths are
 *     unsynchronized owner-thread state. The synchronized one-chunk exception
 *     below may submit an immutable GET through the thread-safe S3 client;
 *   - backward, because blobstore takes its request set from a per-channel free
 *     list and returns it with an unlocked TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL
 *     (spdk/lib/blob/request.c:66, per-channel req_mem in blobstore.c:3667), so
 *     completing on the wrong thread corrupts that list.
 *
 * The exception is a one-chunk read of a chunk with no overlay. Chunk-map,
 * cache and destination-fill metadata synchronize that path internally. A
 * cache hit completes on the submitting thread; a miss may join or start a
 * whole-object GET there. A successful fill with only off-owner waiters
 * publishes RAM and completes those waiters on the GET thread; disk writeback
 * is a message to the cache owner. Owner still finishes fills that have to
 * merge the overlay or retry through s3_bs_io_submit.

 * starts from the new LSN and finds everything. Doing it the other way round --

 * has to be serialised in one synchronous stretch together with the LSN it is
