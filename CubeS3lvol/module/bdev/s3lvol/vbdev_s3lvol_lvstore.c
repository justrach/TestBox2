 *   vbdev_s3lvol_lvstore -- the lvstore and lvol lifecycle
 *
 *   Chain: s3_client_get_or_create -> s3_bs_dev_create -> spdk_lvs_init ->
 *   spdk_lvol_create -> vbdev_s3lvol_bdev_register
 *
 *   === Why maintain our own lvstore list ===
 *
 *   The upstream lvstore<->bdev pairing table g_spdk_lvol_pairs is static
 *   private (vbdev_lvol.c); no external API can insert entries, so the
 *   built-in bdev_lvol_* RPCs are unavailable to us. We keep our own copy for
 *   the bespoke RPCs to look up.
 *
 *   === Why not use the upstream vbdev_lvs_create() ===
 *
 *   It assumes the lvstore sits on a real bdev: it builds its own bs_dev with
 *   spdk_bdev_create_bs_dev_ext() and then unconditionally dereferences
 *   bs_dev->get_base_bdev() (vbdev_lvol.c). Our bs_dev has no bdev
 *   underneath; get_base_bdev is NULL and it would segfault. spdk_lvs_init()
 *   itself only needs a struct spdk_bs_dev *, so the wrapper is bypassed and
 *   it is called directly.

 * Destroy (rcow_delete_lvstore)
 *
 * Unloads the lvstore and then deletes the S3 objects it owned, as opposed to
 * unload, which keeps everything and expects a later attach.
 *
 * The object list is derived rather than listed: s3_list_objects() is still
 * -ENOTSUP, so the data objects come from walking the chunk map (which names
 * every chunk this lvstore has written) and the metadata objects are the four
 * fixed keys, plus one manifest per registered export.
 *
 * What it does *not* cover is orphans -- an object whose mapping never made it
 * into the chunk map, e.g. a create-once delete that failed, or a flush that
 * was cut short before its journal record landed. Those are exactly what GC is
 * for, and until GC exists a destroy can leave some behind. Said plainly here
 * rather than implied, because "delete" reads like it reclaims everything.
 *
 * === Why the unload comes first===
 *
 * The obvious order -- delete, then unload -- is wrong twice over, and the first
 * version of this code had both faults:
 *
 *   - Unload *reads* what it is about to rewrite. Deleting first turns those
 *     metadata reads into 404s, the chunk map is then reported as inconsistent
 *     ("the chunk map entry is wrong"), and spdk_lvs_unload() fails with
 *     -ENOENT. The lvstore is then left in the registry with its data already
 *     gone: unloadable, unattachable, and still listed.
 *
 *   - Unload *writes*. Blobstore flushes its final metadata during unload, those
 *     writes go through create-once like any other, and each one lands as a new
 *     object with a new uuid. Anything enumerated before the unload therefore
 *     misses them -- one leaked object per destroy, every time.
 *
 * So: unload first, take the object list from the final chunk map through
 * s3_bs_dev_set_reap_cb() (the one instant it is both complete and still
 * readable), and delete afterwards. Two consequences follow from the unload
 * having already finished when the deletes are issued:
 *
 *   - The lvstore is freed by then, so nothing here may touch it afterwards.
 *     Everything needed later -- its name, its client -- is taken up front, and
 *     the client is held through a reference of our own.
 *
 *   - A failed unload is now recoverable: nothing has been deleted yet, so the
 *     destroy simply reports the failure and leaves the lvstore intact.

/* ==========================================================================
 * lvstore attach -- re-hang an existing lvstore (including crash recovery)
 *
 * The chain mirrors create, with _open in place of _create and two replays
 * inserted:
 *
 *   s3_client_get_or_create
 *   -> s3_local_dev_open ....... read the layout, capacity and identity back
 *   -> s3_journal_open ......... synchronous, reads checkpoint_lsn only
 *   -> s3_wal_open ............. picks the newer of the two super slots
 *   -> s3_bs_dev_create ........ geometry comes from the super block, not the RPC
 *   -> s3_bs_dev_attach_journal
 *   -> s3_journal_replay ....... rebuild chunk_index -> S3 object
 *   -> s3_bs_dev_attach_wal .... the overlay has to exist before the WAL replay
 *   -> s3_wal_replay ........... re-apply writes that never reached S3
 *   -> spdk_lvs_load_ext
 *   -> register a bdev for every lvol that was found
 *
 * === Why the order is exactly this ===
 *
 * *Both replays must precede spdk_lvs_load_ext().* blobstore reads its super
 * block as its very first action, and that read has to already see the recovered
 * state -- there is no way to tell blobstore "reload, the device changed".
 *
 * *The journal must precede the WAL.* The journal says which S3 objects exist;
 * the WAL then re-applies the writes that had not reached them yet. Replaying in
 * the other order would let a journal record overwrite a newer mapping.
 *
 * *attach_wal must precede the WAL replay* because replayed entries land in the
 * overlay, which attach_wal creates.
 *
 * === Identity checking, and what it cannot cover ===
 *
 * Pairing the wrong local device with an lvstore is destructive: replay would
 * write another lvstore's data into this one. Two checks:
 *
 *   1. lvs_name, compared right after s3_local_dev_open, i.e. *before* any
 *      replay. This catches the plausible operator error (pointing attach at a
 *      leftover image from a different lvstore) at zero cost.
 *   2. lvs_uuid, compared once spdk_lvs_load_ext() has run -- the uuid only
 *      exists inside blobstore, so it cannot be checked earlier. This catches
 *      the case the name misses: the lvstore was destroyed and recreated under
 *      the same name while this disk was kept.
 *
 * The second check is therefore *late*: by the time it fires, the WAL has been
 * replayed into the overlay and the flusher may already have uploaded some of
 * it. Closing that window needs identity metadata in S3 that can be read before
 * blobstore is loaded (the meta/owner object is the natural place), which does
 * not exist yet. Until then a uuid mismatch is reported as a failed attach with
 * a loud log, not as silent tolerance.

 * Snapshots and clones
 *
 * On an S3 backend neither of these **moves data**: a snapshot freezes the
 * origin blob's cluster list into a read-only blob and the origin becomes
 * CoW; a clone's new blob points straight at the parent's clusters. The
 * existing chunk objects stay referenced, and only new writes produce new
 * objects.
 *
 * === Why CoW cannot rewrite a shared chunk ===
 *
 * This was verified in the blobstore before touching it, because guessing
 * wrong silently corrupts snapshots:
 *
 *   blob_can_copy() requires `blob->bs->dev->copy != NULL` **and**
 *   `translate_lba()` to return true. We satisfy neither (copy left NULL,
 *   translate_lba always returns false; the reasons are in the
 *   s3_bs_dev_translate_lba comment), so the "move data inside the device"
 *   fast path can never be entered.
 *
 * The remaining regular path allocates a cluster_sz buffer, reads the whole
 * cluster from the back_bs_dev, then writes to
 *   `bs_cluster_to_lba(bs, ctx->new_cluster)` --
 *   **the write target is a freshly allocated cluster**, landing on a new LBA,
 *   a new chunk, a new uuid, a new S3 object. Rewriting the parent's chunk in
 *   place is impossible on this path.
 *
 * The cost is amplification: a write landing on an unallocated cluster first
 * reads a whole cluster. At 1 MiB chunks and 4 MiB clusters that is 4 GETs
 * plus 4 PUTs. Correct but not cheap; worth benchmarking on a clone before
 * discussing performance.
 *
 * === I/O on the origin volume is frozen during the snapshot ===
 *
 * `spdk_bs_create_snapshot()` freezes the origin blob's I/O internally. If an
 * S3 request is stuck and never returns at that moment, the snapshot stalls
 * with it. This is not solvable here, but it should be the first thing
 * considered when diagnosing.
 * ========================================================================== */

/* Completion callback for snapshot / clone.
 *
 * The only difference from create is what happens when registration fails --
 * and that difference is mandatory. A failed create deletes the lvol; that
 * must not happen here: once the snapshot exists, **the origin is already its
 * clone**, and the blobstore refuses to delete a snapshot that still has a
 * clone. Copying create's behaviour would only produce a failing cleanup plus
 * a misleading error log.
 *
 * So the snapshot is kept and the registration failure is reported honestly.
 * The data is intact; only a bdev is missing, and re-attaching the lvstore

	 * The order further down is: unregister the bdev, and destroy the lvol from
	 * the unregister's callback. blobstore's own refusal therefore arrives after
	 * the bdev is already gone and the lvol already closed, with no way back --
	 * the delete reports failure, and what it leaves behind is a snapshot that
	 * cannot be activated any more, in an lvstore that can no longer be unloaded
	 * at all, because spdk_lvol_close() on an already-closed lvol answers -EINVAL
	 * and lvs_unload_close_lvols() treats that as "not every lvol could be
	 * closed".
	 *
	 * A failed delete has to leave the volume exactly as it was. Checking first
	 * is what does that; rolling the unregister back afterwards would mean
	 * re-registering a bdev whose consumers have already been told it is gone.
	 * This mirrors the export pin check above, which refuses before touching
	 * anything for the same reason.
	 *
	 * The threshold is > 1, not > 0, and that distinction was originally wrong
	 * here. bs_is_blob_deletable() (blobstore.c:8714) refuses unconditionally
	 * only above one clone; at exactly one it sets *update_clone and *merges* the
	 * snapshot into that clone, and spdk_lvol_destroy() cooperates by looking the
	 * clone's lvol up beforehand so it can be fixed up afterwards. Refusing at
	 * one clone therefore rejected something the layers below implement, and
	 * since every snapshot of a live volume has exactly one clone, it made
	 * snapshots undeletable until the volume itself was deleted -- turning a
	 * chain of N snapshots into something that could only be dismantled from the
	 * leaf end. That was a regression, not a safety property.
	 *
	 * Everything else bs_is_blob_deletable() can refuse depends on open_ref,
	 * which is not knowable from here and which the normal path handles by
	 * closing the lvol first. Only the unconditional case is worth pre-empting.
	 *
	 * Querying with ids == NULL asks for the count alone: blobstore then always
	 * takes its -ENOMEM branch after filling *count in, and answers 0 with
	 * count == 0 when the blob is not a snapshot at all. So no separate
	 * spdk_blob_is_snapshot() test is needed. lvol->blob_id rather than
	 * spdk_blob_get_id(lvol->blob), because blob_id stays valid even once the
	 * blob is closed -- which is what upstream does at lvol.c:1584. */
	/* snapshot_destroy_check_clones() runs before any export is released, so a
	 * synchronous clone-count refusal leaves every manifest intact. Once the
	 * release chain has started there is no rollback: an asynchronous blob
	 * failure leaves the snapshot without the export that was already revoked. */

	/* Past the check above, so this volume is not materialising anything -- but it
	 * may be *waiting* to. A queued decouple deliberately does not hold
	 * action_in_progress, since it can sit behind a run that takes minutes, so the
	 * delete is allowed and the queue entry has to go instead. Done here rather
	 * than in the completion path because the queue holds this lvol pointer, and
	 * by then it is freed. */

	 * the upstream vbdev_lvol simply calls spdk_bdev_unregister
	 * (vbdev_lvol.c:686).
	 *
