 *   vbdev_s3lvol_rpc -- bespoke JSON-RPC
 *
 *   === Why bespoke instead of the built-in bdev_lvol_* ===
 *
 *   Every built-in lvol RPC goes through vbdev_lvol_store_first() walking
 *   g_spdk_lvol_pairs (vbdev_lvol.c:20), which is a static private list with
 *   no way for external code to insert entries.
 *
 *   Meanwhile nvmf_* only recognises names in the global bdev registry, so
 *   **only the lvstore/lvol stretch has to be built here**; the nvmf side is
 *   reused with zero code.
 *
 *   Every method is registered under the rcow_ prefix (rcow_create_lvstore,
 *   rcow_attach_lvstore, rcow_create_lvol, ...), not the bdev_s3lvol_ names
 *   this design once called them. The full set, all registered at runtime via
 *   SPDK_RPC_REGISTER:
 *
 *     rcow_create_lvstore / rcow_attach_lvstore / rcow_delete_lvstore
 *     rcow_unload_lvstore / rcow_flush_lvstore / rcow_checkpoint_lvstore
 *     rcow_get_lvstores / rcow_add_s3_config
 *     rcow_create_lvol / rcow_delete_lvol / rcow_resize_lvol
 *     rcow_create_snapshot / rcow_create_clone
 *     rcow_export_snapshot / rcow_get_snapshot_status / rcow_import_lvol
 *     rcow_release_export / rcow_get_exports / rcow_get_imports / rcow_decouple_lvol
 *     rcow_get_decouple
 *     rcow_active_bdev / rcow_active_bdev_batch / rcow_deactive_bdev / rcow_get_bdev
 *     rcow_get_build_info
 *
 *   Credentials do not travel as RPC parameters -- they are read from the
 *   environment (S3_AUTH_ENV), so secrets never land in RPC logs or shell
 *   history.

 * always says so: capacity_gib, size_gib. Both convert with << 30.
 *
 * The unit is in the name on purpose. These started out in bytes, and switching
 * to GiB under the same name would have been the dangerous kind of change: the
 * JSON decoders are strict about unknown keys but say nothing about a value's
 * magnitude, so an un-updated caller would have gone on passing 17179869184 and
 * got a volume 2^30 times too large -- successfully, because thin volumes are
 * never checked against the store's capacity (blobstore.c:2292 only consults
 * free_clusters for thick blobs). Renaming turns that into Invalid parameters.
 *
 * Sizes that are *not* capacities keep their own units: cluster_size and
 * chunk_size are bytes (they are MiB-scale, GiB would be meaningless), and
 * journal_size_mb / wal_size_mb already carry theirs.
 *
 * Replies stay in bytes. They report what was actually reached, and blobstore
 * rounds up to a cluster boundary, so GiB could not express it. The reply field
 * is `size`, never `size_gib`, which keeps the two apart. */

 * agree on a response format any more. rcow_create_lvstore is an operator RPC and

/* ==========================================================================
 * Unified lvol RPC response helpers
 *
 * Every RPC an external caller uses replies with the same two-field object,
 * whether it succeeds or fails:
 *
 *   success  {"bool_value":true,  "string_value":"vol0"}
 *   failure  {"bool_value":false, "string_value":"lvol not found"}
 *
 * This is by design: the callers parse a single shape, and the bool tells them
 * which branch applies. The string is what was produced on success -- a volume
 * name, an export uuid, or a serialised JSON document when there is more than a
 * name to report -- and the error description on failure.
 *
 * Note that a failure is still a JSON-RPC *success*: the reply carries a result,
 * not an error member. That is what makes the shape uniform, and it is why the
 * client in test/tools/s3lvol_rpc.py maps bool_value:false back onto a non-zero
 * exit status -- the transport no longer distinguishes the two, so something has
 * to.
 *
 * The lvstore RPCs are deliberately left out. They are operator entry points
 * driven by rcow_start.sh, they report structured facts (uuid, cluster counts,
 * write-path counters) that no envelope would improve, and a start script that
 * has to unwrap and re-parse them gains nothing.

/* ==========================================================================
 * rcow_create_lvol
 *
 * Two parameters, both required: lvol_name and size_gib.
 *
 * === Why the size is in GiB ===
 *
 * Volumes here are provisioned in GiB, so bytes meant every caller wrote out
 * 17179869184 and every reader had to divide. The name carries the unit, which
 * also keeps it distinct from rcow_resize_lvol's `size` -- that one is still in
 * bytes, and two parameters both called `size` with different units would be a
 * trap. Renaming rather than redefining `size` is deliberate: the decoder is
 * strict, so an old caller passing `size` gets Invalid parameters instead of a
 * volume 2^30 times too big.
 *
 * === Why there is no lvs_name ===
 *
 * There was a field for it, and a branch using it, but the decoder never listed
 * it -- so it could not be passed (the strict decoder rejected the whole
 * request), req.lvs_name was always NULL, and the branch was dead code. This RPC
 * has therefore only ever worked against a single lvstore, which is what
 * rcow_start.sh creates. Removing the field makes that real instead of implied,
 * and the error below now names the actual constraint rather than telling the
 * caller to pass a parameter that does not exist.
 *
 * === Why there is no thin_provision ===
 *
 * It defaulted to true and nothing ever passed false. On an S3 backend thin is
 * the only sensible choice: an unwritten chunk is simply an absent object that
 * reads as zeroes, so thick provisioning would mean writing zeroes to object
 * storage to reserve space that costs nothing to leave unreserved.
 * ========================================================================== */

/* The device path is neither stored nor predicted -- it is looked up by matching
 * the lvol uuid against the namespace uuid the host publishes in sysfs (see the
 * header of vbdev_s3lvol_active.c). That lookup only succeeds once the host has
 * processed the AEN add_ns sent it, which is why rcow_active_bdev cannot answer
 * with a path (see active_bdev_attached) and why this RPC does not answer with
 * a device_path for the first few milliseconds after an activation.
 *
 * Measured, calling both RPCs over one persistent socket: 8-24 ms between the
 * rcow_active_bdev reply and a resolvable path, and 4 out of 5 activations saw
 * at least one empty answer. So every caller had to write a retry loop, and
 * each of them had to know a second thing that is easy to miss: a resolvable
 * path means *sysfs* has the namespace, while the /dev node is created
 * afterwards by udev. rcow_verify_active in rcow_common.sh records a dd that
 * hit ENOENT on a path it had just been told was present.
 *
 * The wait therefore happens here, once, and it waits for the /dev node rather
 * than for sysfs: a non-empty device_path from this RPC is a path that can be
 * opened.
 *
 * === Why a thread and not a poller ===
 *
 * One resolve is an opendir("/sys/block") plus an fopen per nvme device, and a
 * host connected to 32 subsystems has a good many. Retrying that every 20 ms
 * for up to five seconds on the reactor would spend the reactor's time on
 * blocking filesystem I/O. The retry loop runs on a spawner thread instead,
 * which is also kept off the reactor's core (see s3_spawner.h).
 *
 * What that thread may touch is deliberately narrow: sysfs and /dev, nothing
 * else. The active registry is an unlocked global list, so everything that
 * reads it -- the load, the lookup, the iteration -- happens on the RPC thread
 * first, and the fields the wait needs are copied out. The reply is written
 * back on the RPC thread too. jsonrpc does allow a response from any thread
 * ("Might be called from any thread", jsonrpc_internal.h), but the buffer
 * helpers above make no such promise, and there is nothing to gain by
 * finding out. */
