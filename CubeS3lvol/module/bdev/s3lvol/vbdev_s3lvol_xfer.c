 *   vbdev_s3lvol_xfer -- moving a volume between lvstores and between nodes
 *
 *   Three operations, and one callback that is easy to overlook:
 *
 *     export   snapshot the volume, copy the snapshot into export objects,
 *              upload the manifest
 *     import   fetch the manifest, remember it, create an esnap clone whose
 *              read-only parent is that export
 *     release  delete an export's objects once nobody imports it any more
 *
 *     esnap_bs_dev_create   blobstore asking, during load, for the read-only
 *              parent of an esnap clone it just found. *Synchronously.*
 *
 *   That last one is the reason for the imports registry. blobstore persists the
 *   esnap id (here: the export uuid) inside the clone's metadata, and on every
 *   attach it hands that id back and demands a bs_dev in return, right then. It
 *   cannot be told to wait for an S3 GET -- and waiting for one on a reactor
 *   thread that has to poll for its own completion is a deadlock, not a delay.
 *   So every manifest this lvstore might be asked for is fetched *before*
 *   spdk_lvs_load_ext() runs, in one GET of one object.
 *
 *   === What is deliberately not done here ===
 *
 *   No drain, no flush, no checkpoint before an export. The reference design
 *   requires all three, because there the manifest names the source's live
 *   chunk objects and those must already be in S3. In this implementation an
 *   export is a copy read out through blobstore, so whether the source's own
 *   data currently sits in the WAL, the overlay or S3 is blobstore's business,
 *   and the export's validity does not depend on it.
 *
 *   No IO quiescing either. The snapshot is what makes the copy a consistent
 *   point in time; stopping the writer is the orchestrator's job.

 * chunk. A chunk written in several pieces gets an entry as soon as the first

 * records uuids for objects that are still in flight, or that will never exist at
 * all because the next flush of that chunk supersedes them. The importer then
 * reads a 404, or a chunk that is short.
 *
 * Measured: an 8 MiB region exported mid-flush produced a manifest naming 8
 * objects holding 2.75 MiB, one of which was never uploaded under that uuid.
 * Nothing failed on the exporting side.
 *
 * There is no cheap test for "this entry is finished", because a partially written
 * chunk is perfectly legitimate -- valid_bytes below chunk_size is the normal
 * state of a sparse volume, not a symptom. So the flush is unconditional, and it
 * is what the handoff pays for the guarantee that every uuid it names is durable.

 * a handoff -- and doing it through an esnap clone is both slower and more fragile
 * than it needs to be. A same-bucket export is REF layout by default, so the
 * manifest references the source's *live* chunk objects rather than copies of them;
 * measured, a self-import built that way stops reading after the lvstore is
 * unloaded and attached again. A local clone has no such dependency: blobstore
 * refuses to delete a snapshot that has clones, so the parent is pinned by the
 * clone relationship itself rather than by an export that can be released.
 *
 * The export side is deliberately untouched: whether a manifest will be consumed
 * here or on another node is the caller's business and cannot be known when it is
 * written. So the degeneration happens here, on the import, where the answer is
 * observable.
 *
 * Returns the local parent to clone, or NULL to take the esnap path.
 *
 * All three conditions matter:
 *
 *   - endpoint, bucket and prefix must all match. The prefix alone is the lvstore
 *     name, and the same name can exist in another bucket or behind another
 *     endpoint; matching on it alone would clone the wrong volume's snapshot.
 *   - the named snapshot must still exist here and still be read-only.
 *     s3lvol_lvol_create_clone() requires a read-only parent, and a writable one
 *     would mean parent and clone could both modify shared clusters.
 *   - the blob id must match. This is the one that is easy to leave out and worst
 *     to get wrong: a snapshot can be deleted and another created under the same
 *     name, and then the name resolves to a blob that is not what was exported.
 *     Cloning it would hand back data the caller never asked for, silently. The
 *     name is a label; the blob id is the identity.
 *
 * Any condition failing means the esnap path, which is always correct -- just more
 * expensive. That covers the case the DENSE layout exists for: the source snapshot
 * is gone, and the export's own copy of the data is the only thing left.

/* ==========================================================================
 * Decouple
 *
 * The importer's way out of depending on the exporting node: materialise what the
 * export actually holds, then stop being its clone. Both halves need an API the
 * upstream blobstore does not have, which is what patches/0002 and 0003 add.
 *
 * === Not spdk_lvol_decouple_parent() ===
 *
 * The name is deliberate -- this is the same intent -- but it is not that call and
 * cannot be. For an esnap clone spdk_lvol_decouple_parent() is identical to a full
 * inflate: bs_inflate_blob_open_cpl() overrides allocate_all to true for such a
 * blob (blobstore.c:7287), so "decouple, keeping it thin" is exactly the thing the
 * public API cannot express.
 *
 * === Why not inflate ===
 *
 * spdk_bs_inflate_blob() would do this in one call, and it was what this used to
 * do. For an esnap clone it allocates *every* cluster -- blobstore forces
 * allocate_all and bs_cluster_needs_allocation() returns true for all of them --
 * so the cost follows the provisioned size rather than the data, and the volume
 * comes out thick. A 16 TiB volume holding 10 GiB is16.7 million cluster
 * allocations and needs 16 TiB of free clusters to succeed at all.
 *
 * Here the manifest says which chunks exist, so only the clusters covering them
 * are copied. Same-bucket imports use CopyObject plus a chunk-map insert
 * (s3_bs_dev ingest) instead of GET+WAL; the GET path remains the fallback when
 * the buckets differ or ingest cannot start. Everything else stays a hole, and
 * the volume stays thin. The cost is the data, once.
 *
 * === What it costs the volume ===
 *
 * Nothing, in availability terms: the volume is readable and writable throughout.
 * blobstore's IO path does not consult locked_operation_in_progress, and the
 * copies run on their own channel. What a caller does notice is that snapshot,
 * clone, resize and delete are refused while this runs -- see the
 * action_in_progress check in the delete and derive paths -- and that the last
 * step freezes IO for the duration of one metadata write.
 *
 * === Interrupted runs ===
 *
 * Resumable, and that is not incidental: a crash halfway leaves a volume that is
 * still an esnap clone, with the clusters it did materialise already allocated,
 * and a registry entry that still names the export. Running decouple again skips
 * those clusters (spdk_blob_materialize_cluster() reports an allocated cluster as
 * done) and finishes the rest. The one order that matters is that the parent is
 * cleared *last*: clearing it first would turn every unfinished cluster into
 * zeroes, silently.

/* Whatever a newly requested decouple has to wait for, or NULL if it may start.
 *
 * Two separate reasons, both of which end in the same queue.
 *
 * The same export, on any lvstore. Materialising means fetching every chunk the
 * export holds, so N decouples of one export pull the same gigabytes N times over,
 * competing for the same client and the same bandwidth, and each finishes later
 * than it would have alone. Across lvstores too: what is being rationed is the
 * transfer of a particular export's objects, and two lvstores importing the same
 * export fetch the very same keys.
 *
 * The same lvstore, whatever the export. This one is not about bandwidth but about
 * blobstore: cluster allocation is serialised per io channel, a channel is per
 * thread per blobstore, and every decouple runs on the same thread. So
 * bs_allocate_and_copy_cluster() queues -- "Queue the user op to block other
 * incoming operations" -- for the whole duration of another cluster's allocation,
 * including its read from S3. Two decouples of one lvstore therefore never overlap
 * inside blobstore no matter what they are told to do.
 *
 * Letting them try anyway is worse than making them wait, which is why this
 * function reports the second reason at all. Measured on 43 clusters running
 * underneath 700 on one lvstore: 71 seconds instead of the 3 it takes alone, with
 * its first cluster losing the channel over 500 times in a row. Nothing was
 * gained by the overlap -- the work was serialised regardless -- and what was lost
 * was any bound on how long the smaller volume takes, since it is only ever
 * offered the channel when the larger one happens to be between clusters.
 *
 * Correctness does not depend on this. spdk_blob_materialize_cluster() re-offers a
 * cluster that lost the channel, so the data arrives either way; before that fix
 * it did not, and the volume was detached from an export it had never read. What
 * this adds is that the waiting is now visible in rcow_get_decouple, bounded by
 * the queue rather than by a retry counter, and in the order the requests came in.
