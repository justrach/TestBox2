 *   vbdev_s3lvol_active -- the /data/cubelet/rcow/active_lvols registry
 *
 *   Records which lvol or snapshot is exposed through which NVMf subsystem and
 *   namespace ID, so that a restart can put the host-side layout back exactly as
 *   it was.
 *
 *   Format:
 *
 *     {
 *       "vol0":  {"uuid":"d39dab5f-...","subsys":3,"nsid":7},
 *       "snap0": {"uuid":"520e77a7-...","subsys":3,"nsid":42}
 *     }
 *
 *   === What is deliberately *not* in here ===
 *
 *   The device path. Measured on a live target: nsid 7 came up as /dev/nvme0n1
 *   and nsid 42 as /dev/nvme0n2 -- the host numbers namespaces in the order it
 *   discovers them, not by nsid. Replay the same two namespaces in the other
 *   order and the two paths swap. A recorded path would therefore be a lie
 *   after the first recovery, and a lie of the worst kind: the upper layer would
 *   mount the wrong volume with no error anywhere.
 *
 *   So the path is never stored and never predicted. It is looked up when asked
 *   for, by matching the lvol uuid against the namespace uuid the host exposes
 *   in sysfs -- which is the same value, because vbdev_s3lvol_lvol.c sets
 *   bdev->uuid = lvol->uuid and NVMf passes it through.
 *
 *   Read-only-ness, for a different reason: nothing consumes it. There is no
 *   read-only field in struct spdk_nvmf_ns_opts and no write-protected
 *   namespace anywhere in lib/nvmf, so a snapshot is handed to the host as a
 *   writable device regardless; writes come down and are refused by the lvol
 *   layer, which the host sees as an I/O error. A flag here would suggest a
 *   protection that does not exist.
 *
 *   === Why uuid is stored alongside the name ===
 *
 *   The name is the key, but a name can be reused: delete vol0 and create vol0
 *   again and it is a different volume with a different uuid. Replaying an old
 *   (name -> nsid) mapping onto it would hand the host a namespace that looks
 *   like the one it had before and contains something else. The uuid is what
 *   makes that detectable, so recovery compares it and refuses on a mismatch.
 *
 *   === Threading: every access must stay on the one RPC thread ===
 *
 *   g_active is an unlocked global list, and that is safe only because every
 *   reader and writer runs on the thread that serves the RPCs (the master
 *   thread). This is not an accident that the code happens to satisfy, it is a
 *   contract that several unrelated decisions hold up:
 *
 *   - the RPC server's poller runs on the master thread, so every handler --
 *     and with it every load / find / first / next / alloc_nsid call -- is
 *     serialised there;
 *   - the registry is written from completion callbacks that SPDK bounces back
 *     to the thread which started the operation: nvmf state changes via
 *     spdk_thread_exec_msg on the thread recorded at submission (subsystem.c),
 *     and bdev unregister completions on the io_device's registration thread,
 *     which is the same RPC thread for every operation in this module;
 *   - rcow_get_bdev's wait runs on a spawner thread, but that thread never
 *     touches this list -- it is handed copies of the entries, taken by value
 *     on the RPC thread, and only touches sysfs and /dev.
 *
 *   The first two are also the fragile ones. Adding a second RPC server, or
 *   starting a registry operation from a poller or the spawner, breaks the
 *   single-thread assumption silently: concurrent finds while another call
 *   frees an entry are a use-after-free, not a race that happens to work. If a
 *   new caller cannot guarantee this thread, it must bounce through
 *   spdk_thread_send_msg first or take the registry lock -- one or the other,
 *   never neither.
