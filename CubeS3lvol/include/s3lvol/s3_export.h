 *   Cross-node transfer: export a snapshot, import it as an external clone
 *
 *   === What an export is ===
 *
 *   A self-contained, immutable, read-only copy of one snapshot, living in S3
 *   under its own prefix, described by a single manifest object:
 *
 *     <prefix>/exports/<export-uuid>.json        the manifest
 *     <prefix>/exports/<export-uuid>/<idx>       one object per non-zero chunk
 *
 *   The importing node needs nothing but those objects: no access to the source
 *   lvstore's chunk map, no agreement on cluster size, and no coordination with
 *   the source node. Once the manifest is up, the source may delete the
 *   snapshot, the volume, or the whole lvstore.
 *
 *   === Why it is a copy and not a reference ===
 *
 *   The design document has the manifest point straight at the source's live
 *   chunk objects, which would make an export pure metadata. That needs a
 *   translation from "offset inside this blob" to "LBA on the bs_dev", and no
 *   public blobstore API offers one -- the cluster table is private. Theways to
 *   obtain it anyway (reading blobstore's private structs, or probing the bs_dev
 *   with a one-block read) all fail by producing a *wrong* uuid, and a wrong
 *   uuid still reads back perfectly good bytes belonging to something else. That
 *   is a silent-corruption failure mode, so v1 pays for a copy instead.
 *
 *   The copy also keeps garbage collection trivial: export objects live under
 *   their own prefix, so nothing in <prefix>/data/ becomes live by being
 *   exported, and the design's cross-node pin / refcount machinery is not needed
 *   at all.
 *
 *   Cost, stated plainly: an export reads and re-uploads the allocated bytes of
 *   the snapshot once, and doubles their storage for as long as the export
 *   lives. The manifest carries a `layout` field so a future zero-copy variant
 *   (or a server-side CopyObject one) can be added without changing importers.
