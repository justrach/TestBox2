 *   S3 client abstract interface
 *
 *   === Key design constraint ===
 *   This header **must not expose any aws-c-* type**. struct s3_client is an
 *   opaque pointer; everything CRT-related is confined to
 *   lib/s3bsdev/s3_client_aws.c. Replacing the SDK later then touches exactly
 *   one file.
 *
 *   Every interface is asynchronous: the actual HTTP I/O is carried by CRT's
 *   event_loop_group threads, and on completion the callback is bounced back
 *   to the submitting SPDK thread via spdk_thread_send_msg. The caller is
 *   never blocked on a reactor.

/**
 * === Callback thread semantics ===
 *
 * Every callback runs on the **SPDK thread that submitted the request**. The
 * implementation records `spdk_get_thread()` at submission time, and once CRT
 * finishes the request on its own I/O threads it bounces the callback back with
 * `spdk_thread_send_msg()`. So a callback may safely touch blobstore / bdev /
 * channel state.
 *
 * Exception: if the submission was not on an SPDK thread (a plain pthread,
 * such as unit tests and command-line tools), the callback runs in place on
 * the CRT thread -- in that scenario there is no SPDK state to protect anyway.
 *
 * **The caller must outlive its own in-flight requests.** There is no graceful
 * failure for `spdk_thread_send_msg()`: sending a message to an exited thread
 * `abort()`s directly. So the thread that submitted a request must not exit
 * before every callback has fired, and the `cb_arg` used in callbacks must not
 * be freed early. This matches SPDK's requirement for bdev I/O.
 *
 * One consequence: **a callback may fire at any moment after the submitting
 * function returns**, and may only be processed at the submitting thread's next
 * poll. Never assume it has already run.
