 *   s3_cache -- local read cache for S3 chunk objects
 *
 *   === What it is for ===
 *
 *   A read that misses everything local costs an S3 GET, tens of milliseconds.
 *   The case that matters is the one right after a flush: the flusher assembles
 *   the whole chunk in order to PUT it, and on success s3_overlay drops the blocks
 *   it had been serving reads from (overlay_block_release in s3_overlay.c). The
 *   read latency for that data goes from ~0 to a full S3 round trip at the instant
 *   the upload succeeds, even though the bytes were local a moment before. A
 *   filesystem notices at once: inode and directory blocks are written and read
 *   straight back.
 *
 *   So the flush hands its buffer over on the way past, for the price of one local
 *   write and no extra request. Native reads that had to go to S3 do the same
 *   with whatever they fetched. Imported export parents use a lower-priority
 *   exact-object-key lane so another import can reuse the same immutable bytes.
 *
 *   Note there is nothing to gain from also populating when a read-modify-write
 *   flush reads its base object back: those bytes are merged into the new object
 *   and cached under the new uuid by the flush that read them. Caching them
 *   separately under the base uuid would cost a second chunk-sized write to store
 *   an object the same flush is about to delete, in a slot the new version takes
 *   over as soon as the PUT lands.
 *
 *   === Partial residency, and why a slot needs a bitmap ===
 *
 *   A slot holds one object, but not necessarily all of it. A read miss caches
 *   exactly the range it fetched, which is what a filesystem read looks like:
 *   ext4 reads ahead 128 KiB against a chunk of 1 MiB, so requiring a whole
 *   object before anything could be cached meant a mounted volume never
 *   populated from reads at all and stayed cold forever, no matter how many
 *   times the same blocks were read.
 *
 *   Which range is present therefore cannot be a scalar. It used to be:
 *   valid_bytes alone, read as "[0, valid_bytes) is here". Filling a slot from
 *   a read of [512 KiB, 640 KiB) under that model has no honest encoding --
 *   setting valid_bytes to 640 KiB claims the first 512 KiB as well, and a read
 *   of it would be served whatever the slot's previous tenant left on the
 *   device. Silent corruption, which is far worse than a miss.
 *
 *   So residency is a bitmap of block_size units, and valid_bytes keeps only the
 *   meaning it always had for the *object*: its length, past which reads are
 *   zeroes. A read is a hit when every block it covers is set (a request that is
 *   only partly resident is a miss, not a split I/O), or when it lies entirely
 *   past valid_bytes, which is answerable from the length alone.
 *
 *   The last block of an object may be partly filled -- valid_bytes need not be
 *   a multiple of block_size -- and is set once the range that reaches the
 *   object's end has landed. Reads clamp to valid_bytes and zero the rest, so
 *   the bytes past the end are never served from the device.
 *
 *   === Why entries can never go stale ===
 *
 *   Objects are immutable: every flush generates a fresh uuid and PUTs a new key
 *   (create-once, P2 -- s3_bs_dev.c s3_flush_put / s3_chunk_write_put). A uuid
 *   therefore names one immutable byte sequence for as long as it exists.
 *
 *   So a cache entry tagged with the uuid it came from *cannot be wrong*. There
 *   is no invalidation protocol, no coherence window, and no ordering
 *   requirement against the chunk map or the journal. When a chunk is rewritten,
 *   the reader resolves chunk_index to a new uuid, the tag no longer matches, and
 *   the entry is simply a miss. That is the single property this whole module
 *   rests on; anything that makes object contents mutable invalidates it.
 *
 *   === Why nothing here needs to survive a crash ===
 *
 *   Every byte is a copy of an object that is already durable in S3, so the
 *   cache is never the only holder of anything. The index is therefore RAM-only
 *   and a restart comes up cold. That is a warm-up cost, not a correctness
 *   property, and adding a persistent index later needs no change to what is
 *   written here: it would be a new region in the super block (which records
 *   regions explicitly for exactly this reason, see s3_local_dev.h), not a
 *   different layout of this one.
 *
 *   This is also what keeps the module out of the write path. It holds *clean
 *   data only*: nothing is ever dirty here, so there is no flush order to
 *   respect and no way for a bug in this file to lose an acknowledged write. The
 *   worst it can do is serve a miss.
 *
 *   === RAM hot tier and on-disk layout ===
 *
 *   Whole-object populates may also enter a fixed anonymous-memory pool. They
 *   become readable there as soon as the caller's immutable bytes have been
 *   copied, without waiting for the best-effort device write. RAM entries have
 *   their own LRU and pins; evicting one only falls back to the device and does
 *   not invalidate a disk-resident range.
 *
 *   The cache region is a flat array of chunk-sized slots:
 *
 *     slot i  ->  region.offset + i * chunk_size
 *
 *   Slot to content is decided at runtime and held in RAM only, so there is
 *   nothing on disk to keep consistent. A block of a slot that no populate has
 *   written holds whatever the slot's previous tenant left; the residency bitmap
 *   is what keeps it from ever being read.
 *
 *   === Threading ===
 *
 *   Metadata is protected internally. Drop and the convenience read API use the
 *   owner-thread channel. Reads may instead supply a channel owned by their
 *   calling SPDK thread through s3_cache_read_on_channel().
 *
 *   s3_cache_populate() may run on any SPDK thread: the RAM hot copy is
 *   published under the mutex on the caller, and a disk fill is submitted on
 *   the owner channel (inline, or by a message to that thread). At most one
 *   unpublished hot buf is reserved per chunk_index so two populates of the
 *   same object cannot both memcpy and then publish.
