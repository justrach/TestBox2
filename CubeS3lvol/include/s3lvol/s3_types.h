/* Snapshot chain depth limits.

 * MAX is a hard consequence rather than a policy: export_build_chain() walks the
 * chain into a stack array of this size, and a chain deeper than it makes
 * export_snapshot fall back to copying the whole volume. That fallback is correct
 * but expensive and, because a copied (dense) export is never reaped, permanent.
 *
 * SOFT is where that becomes worth saying out loud. Nothing enforces it -- a
 * snapshot is the user's to keep, and refusing to create one because a chain is
 * long would break an ordinary workflow to avoid a cost the user may be happy to
 * pay. So it warns, once per lvol per crossing, and the depth is reported by
 * rcow_get_lvstores so a control plane can act before the cliff rather than
 * discover it afterwards.
 *
 * The gap between the two is the room to act in: eight snapshots' worth. */
