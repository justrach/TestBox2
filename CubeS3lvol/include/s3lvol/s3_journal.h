 *   s3_journal -- change log for the chunk map
 *
 *   === This is a change log, not a periodic flush ===
 *
 *   The rule is explicit: *every* modification of the chunk map is appended to
 *   the journal immediately, and the journal is durable as soon as it hits the
 *   local bdev. It is not a batch that gets flushed later.
 *
 *   That means journal write latency lands directly in the user write path
 *   (chunk map changes happen after the flusher completes its PUT), so this
 *   has to be a sequential append with as few I/Os as possible.
 *
 *   === Why it is needed at all ===
 *
 *   The chunk map maps chunk_index -> S3 object uuid, and the uuid is freshly
 *   generated on every write-new-then-swap (create-once, P2), so it *cannot be
 *   recomputed*. Losing the map means every object in S3 becomes an orphan:
 *   the data is still there, but nothing knows which object backs which LBA
 *   range.
 *
 *   This is exactly the hard limitation left over from the early design: the
 *   chunk map was memory-only, so stopping the process lost the data.
 *
 *   === Division of labour with checkpoints ===
 *
 *   The journal records *increments* and grows without bound, so it needs a
 *   periodic checkpoint that snapshots the whole table to S3, after which the
 *   journal can be truncated up to the LSN the snapshot covers.
 *
 *     journal     written on every change, local bdev, per-record durability
 *     checkpoint  triggered by 60 s / 128 MiB of journal / 100k changes,
 *                 stored in S3, full-table snapshot
 *
 *   Recovery order : rebuild the table from the checkpoint, then replay
 *   the journal records whose LSN is greater than checkpoint_lsn.
 *
 *   === Fully asynchronous: there is no synchronous API, and none should be
 *       added back ===
 *
 *   Everything that touches the bdev is callback-based. *There used to be a
 *   synchronous implementation* (submit via spdk_bdev_write() then spin in
 *   place on `while (!done) spdk_thread_poll()`); it has been deleted.
 *
 *   It was not deleted because it was slow. It was deleted because *nesting
 *   spdk_thread_poll() corrupts the spdk_thread state machine*:
 *
 *   The journal is written from inside a chunk map change, and chunk map
 *   changes are triggered by S3 PUT completions (s3_chunk_write_done() in
 *   s3_bs_dev.c). Those have already bounced onto the owner thread, which in
 *   production is a reactor message callback. Calling spdk_thread_poll() there
 *   makes the reactor re-enter itself:
 *
 *     - The outer frame is iterating active_pollers; the inner poll runs that
 *       same set again. A poller's state is flipped to RUNNING by the inner
 *       pass, and when the outer pass resumes it hits `default: assert(false)`
 *       in thread_execute_poller(). Release builds are compiled with -DNDEBUG
 *       (spdk.common.mk:297), so the assert disappears and it becomes silent
 *       state-machine corruption.
 *     - The inner poll also drains *other* messages, including other S3
 *       completions, which call back into the chunk map and nest another level.
 *       Stack depth ends up proportional to the number of concurrent I/Os.
 *     - Completion on the local bdev itself depends on a poller (aio relies on
 *       bdev_aio_group_poll). If the nesting happens inside that poller's own
 *       call stack it is already RUNNING, so the inner pass cannot run it --
 *       the completion never arrives and the `while` spins forever.
 *
 *   Unit tests did not catch this because a unit test has a single thread, no
 *   other pollers, and calls in from main's ordinary control flow -- which
 *   happens to be the only place nested polling is safe. *Do not use "the unit
 *   test passes" as evidence that it is safe.*
 *
 *   === Write strategy: batch within a block, one write in flight ===
 *
 *   A record is 64 bytes and a 4 KiB block holds 64 of them. The full contents
 *   of the current block are mirrored in memory, so an append fills a slot and
 *   rewrites the whole block -- having the mirror is what avoids a
 *   read-modify-write.
 *
 *   Only *one block write may be in flight at a time* (write_in_flight). This
 *   is not throttling, it is required for correctness: block_buf is shared
 *   mutable state, so modifying it while a write is in flight means the DMA
 *   reads the post-modification bytes. Worse, if that modification rolled over
 *   to a new block (memset), the in-flight write would push a block of zeroes
 *   and destroy records that were already durable.
 *
 *   Appends that arrive while a write is in flight go on the waiting queue and
 *   are filled into the same block once it completes. So heavier load means
 *   bigger batches, which actually lowers write amplification.
 *
 *   LSNs are assigned *when a record is queued*, not when the callback fires,
 *   so queue order is LSN order and replay can simply scan in physical order.
 *
 *   === Threading ===
 *
 *   Same as the chunk map: one journal belongs to one lvstore and is only
 *   touched on that lvstore's owner thread. No internal locking.
