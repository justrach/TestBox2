 *   Chunk map -- maps LBA ranges to S3 objects
 *
 *   An s3lvol address space is cut into fixed-size chunks, and each chunk backs
 *   one S3 object (key = <prefix>/data/<uuid>). This module owns only the
 *   "chunk_index -> uuid" mapping; it never touches S3 and issues no I/O, which
 *   is what lets it be unit tested without CRT.
 *
 *   === Persistence ===
 *
 *   Once a journal is attached (s3_chunk_map_set_journal), every insert and
 *   remove writes its record to the journal before mutating memory, so the
 *   mapping survives a process restart. Without a journal it degrades to
 *   memory-only, which is still useful for unit tests and for cases that do not
 *   need persistence.
 *
 *   === Threading ===
 *
 *   Lookup is safe from multiple SPDK threads and is synchronized against
 *   insert/remove commits by an internal rwlock. Mutation still belongs to the
 *   lvstore owner thread: pending intent and journal callback ordering rely on
 *   that single submitter even though committed readers may run elsewhere.
