 *   s3_bs_dev: maps a linear LBA space onto a local bdev (WAL/Cache) + S3
 *   objects
 *
 *   === Core role ===
 *   Implements struct spdk_bs_dev (defined in the SPDK public header
 *   include/spdk/blob.h) as the blobstore's underlying "virtual raw
 *   disk". The blobstore is completely unaware of S3; every read/write it
 *   issues is a linear LBA, including the blobstore's own metadata (super
 *   block / metadata blob / blob metadata pages) -- all of it persists through
 *   the same WAL -> chunk -> S3 path with no special handling (keeping the P1
 *   reuse principle).
 *
 *   === Three-level mapping ===
 *     LBA --[shift, compute]--> chunk_index --[chunk_map, table]--> uuid --[concat, compute]--> S3 key
 *   Only the middle level needs a table lookup.
