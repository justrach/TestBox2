 *   s3_overlay -- RAM view of data that is durable in the WAL but not yet in S3
 *   (the RAM half of the chunk cache)
 *
 *   === Why this exists ===
 *
 *   The WAL makes a write durable without putting it in S3. Between the
 *   acknowledgement and the flusher's PUT there is a window in which S3 still
 *   holds the previous version of the chunk. A read served straight from S3
 *   during that window returns stale data, which is strictly worse than the
 *   lost-update bug the WAL was introduced to fix: losing an unacknowledged
 *   write is a durability question, whereas returning an old version of an
 *   *acknowledged* write breaks read-after-write outright.
 *
 *   So the overlay is not an optimisation. *It must go live in the same change
 *   as the flusher.* A flusher without an overlay opens exactly the window
 *   described above.
 *
 *   === What it stores ===
 *
 *   Blocks, keyed by LBA, grouped by chunk:
 *
 *     chunk_index -> [ block 0 | block 1 | ... | block N-1 ]
 *
 *   Grouping by chunk is what lets the flusher do *one* read-modify-write per
 *   chunk however many small writes landed in it -- which is the property that
 *   removes the concurrent-RMW race by construction rather than by locking.
 *
 *   A block is in one of three states: absent (S3 is authoritative), holding
 *   data, or known to be zero. Zero has to be represented explicitly: after a
 *   write_zeroes, "absent" would fall through to whatever S3 still has, which
 *   is the old non-zero content.
 *
 *   === Ordering ===
 *
 *   Every write carries the seq the WAL assigned it, and a block only ever moves
 *   forward: a write whose seq is below the seq already recorded is dropped.
 *   That makes the overlay insensitive to the order in which writes are applied,
 *   which matters for replay -- recovery may re-apply entries that the flusher
 *   already consumed, and after the ring wraps the physical scan order is not
 *   the seq order.
 *
 *   === Flush handshake ===
 *
 *   A flush must not lose writes that arrive while it is running, and must not
 *   drop blocks it has not actually uploaded. Both come from one flag per
 *   block:
 *
 *     flush_begin  marks every dirty block "flushing" and reports the view
 *     writes       arriving now clear the flag and re-dirty the block
 *     flush_end    drops the blocks still marked flushing (success) or
 *                  re-dirties them (failure)
 *
 *   So a block written during a flush is kept and flushed again next round,
 *   and a failed flush loses nothing.
 *
 *   === Threading ===
 *
 *   Writes, apply, flush, and destroy stay on the lvstore owner thread, same
 *   contract as the chunk map, the journal and the WAL. There is no internal
 *   lock around the block arrays.
 *
 *   The chunk pointer table is the one exception: create publishes a pointer
 *   with release, free stores NULL before releasing the struct, and
 *   s3_overlay_chunk_is_live() is an acquire load. Off-owner dest cache uses
 *   that to skip only the dirty chunk rather than every dest read.

/* Cap on the data held in RAM. Past this the caller must apply backpressure

 * completes a chunk, so an unbounded overlay turns a slow S3 into an OOM.
 *
 * 4 GiB rather than the 256 MiB this started at, because the overlay is what
 * decides how long a write may stay out of S3. The WAL bounds durability and has
 * 32 GiB to play with; the overlay bounds *readability* -- a block not held here
 * would have to be served from S3, which still has the previous version -- so it
 * is the overlay that runs out first and forces a flush. Holding a chunk back
 * until it is worth uploading (see s3_overlay_set_flush_policy) is only possible
 * within this budget: at 50 MiB/s of incoming writes, 256 MiB is five seconds.
 *
 * This is ordinary malloc'd memory, not part of the DPDK allocation, so it shows
 * up as process RSS. It is a ceiling and not a reservation -- an idle lvstore
 * holds nothing.
