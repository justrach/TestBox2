#  Build a release package: a directory (and a tarball) that runs on a machine
#  with no SPDK tree, no AWS CRT and no copy of this repository.
#
#  Usage:
#    ./make_release.sh                       # build, verify, tar
#    ./make_release.sh --version 1.2.0       # default is a git describe
#    ./make_release.sh --outdir /tmp/rel     # default is ./release
#    ./make_release.sh --no-tar              # leave the directory, skip the tarball
#    ./make_release.sh --skip-build           # package whatever is already built
#    ./make_release.sh --skip-smoke           # skip the DPDK EAL target smoke only
#                                             # (layout + rpc.py --help still run)
#
#  Both build types are recorded in VERSION, and a package that is not a release
#  build says so at the end. They default to the development setting, which is
#  the right default to build with and the wrong one to deploy:
#
#    AWS_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ./setup_dep.sh --force aws
#    make S3LVOL_BUILD_TYPE=release && ./make_release.sh

#
#  === What makes this packageable at all ===
#
#  Two properties, both established earlier and both worth restating because the
#  package silently stops working if either is lost:
#
#  1. bin/s3lvol_tgt links SPDK, DPDK and OpenSSL statically and carries no
#     RPATH. It is checked below rather than assumed -- a single -L/-l
#     reintroducing a shared librte_* or libssl.so.1.1 would produce a package
#     that runs perfectly on the build machine.
#  2. scripts/rcow_*.sh detect their layout instead of being rewritten here. The
#     scripts that ship are byte-identical to the ones the test suite runs, which
#     is the only way their behaviour in the package follows from anything that
#     was tested.
#
#  === What is deliberately not in the package ===
#
#  - Python from spdk/python other than cli/ and rpc/: sma/ wants grpc and
#    spdkcli/ wants configshell. Shipping them would put imports in the package
#    that cannot succeed, and the first person to hit one has to work out whether
#    it matters.
#  - s3.cfg and the WAL image. Both are per-machine state: s3.cfg holds
#    credentials, and the WAL image's size fixes the journal layout, so a copy
#    from elsewhere is an lvstore whose log belongs to another node.
#  - the test suite. It needs a source tree, fio, and its own credentials.
