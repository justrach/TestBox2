# Sandbox Lifecycle

A sandbox is the core runtime unit of Cube-Sandbox. This page covers a sandbox's full lifecycle — from creation to teardown — and how to let the platform manage it automatically to save resources.

> The SDK shape mirrors [e2b](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox) so existing e2b code can port with minimal changes.

## State Model

A sandbox is always in exactly one of these states:

| State        | Meaning                                                                                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `running`    | Active. Real CPU/memory in use. Accepts requests and executes code.                            |
| `pausing`    | Platform is taking the VM snapshot (transient).                                                |
| `paused`     | Snapshot persisted to disk. **Zero** CPU/memory cost. Full state preserved.                    |
| `resuming`   | Platform is restoring the snapshot (transient).                                                |
| `terminated` | Killed (`kill()`) or reaped after `on_timeout="kill"`. Cannot be brought back.                 |

Two settings drive transitions:

- **`timeout`** (optional): seconds of **idle** time before a timeout fires (e2b uses milliseconds via `timeoutMs`; Cube uses seconds). When omitted, the server decides — the SDK no longer injects a hard-coded default.
- **`on_timeout`**: what happens at timeout — `"kill"` (default; destroy) or `"pause"` (snapshot for later resume).

`timeout` values (e2b-aligned):

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| omitted | Server default idle TTL; if the server has no positive default, the sandbox **never** times out |
| `NEVER_TIMEOUT` (`-1`) | **Never** time out — no idle reclamation |
| `0` | **Immediate** timeout — reclaimed on the first idle sweep |
| positive integer `N` | Timeout after **N** seconds of idle time |

Go: `cubesandbox.NeverTimeout`; Python: `from cubesandbox import NEVER_TIMEOUT`.

## Create

```python
from cubesandbox import Sandbox

# Create a sandbox that auto-destroys after 60 seconds of idle.
# (Default on_timeout is "kill".)
sandbox = Sandbox.create(
    template="<your-template-id>",
    timeout=60,               # seconds
)

print(sandbox.sandbox_id)
```

Key parameters of `Sandbox.create()`:

| Parameter               | Description                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `template`              | Template ID used to boot the sandbox; defaults to env var `CUBE_TEMPLATE_ID`.                |
| `timeout`               | Optional idle timeout in seconds; see the table above |
| `lifecycle`             | Lifecycle policy — see [Platform-managed auto-pause / auto-resume](#platform-managed-auto-pause-auto-resume) below. |
| `metadata`              | Arbitrary key/value pairs stored on the sandbox; readable from the list / detail endpoints. |
| `env_vars`              | Environment variables injected into the sandbox process.                                     |
| `allow_internet_access` | Whether outbound internet is allowed; `network` provides finer-grained egress control.       |

> Cube doesn't impose hard wall-clock ceilings (24h Pro / 1h Base) the way hosted e2b does. When you omit `timeout`, the effective idle TTL is set by your cluster operator — see [Operational Notes](#operational-notes) below.

## Inspect a Running Sandbox

```python
info = sandbox.get_info()
print(info)
# {
#   "sandboxID": "iiny0783cype8gmoawzmx-ce30bc46",
#   "templateID": "rki5dems9wqfm4r03t7g",
#   "state": "running",
#   "startedAt": "2026-06-17T12:34:56Z",
#   "endAt":     "2026-06-17T12:39:56Z",
#   "metadata":  {...}
# }
```

`endAt` is the projected next-timeout instant given the current `timeout`. It is refreshed every time the sandbox receives a request (or when you call `set_timeout`, when available). Pausing does not cancel a finite idle deadline, so both detail and list APIs continue to return the same `endAt` while the sandbox is paused. For **never-timeout** sandboxes there is no deadline, so `endAt` is **omitted** from the response rather than reported as equal to `startedAt`.

## List Running Sandboxes

```python
for sb in Sandbox.list():
    print(sb["sandboxID"], sb["state"])
```

## Explicit Shutdown

```python
sandbox.kill()
```

`kill()` is **irreversible**: unlike pause, a killed sandbox cannot be brought back, even when `lifecycle.on_timeout="pause"` was set — `kill()` always wins and discards the snapshot.

### Deleting a Paused Sandbox

Both `kill()` and `DELETE /sandboxes/{sandboxID}` can delete sandboxes in the `running` or `paused` state.

When deleting a `paused` sandbox, CubeSandbox does **not** resume or wake the MicroVM. It removes the paused tombstone, deletes the pause snapshot (catalog / CoW), and clears control-plane pause metadata. Plugin-volume refcounts were already adjusted at Pause time, so delete does not re-attach volumes only to tear them down again.

The API remains synchronous: it returns `204 No Content` only after cleanup finishes. This path is not a resume:

- It does not emit a `sandbox.resumed` lifecycle event.
- It does not reset the idle timeout.
- It does not require node capacity admission (there is no restore-before-delete).

When deleting a `paused` sandbox, the following responses are possible:

- **`204 No Content`**: The sandbox, pause snapshot, and related resources have been cleaned up.
- **`503 Service Unavailable` + `Retry-After: 2`**: The sandbox is entering the paused state, or another lifecycle operation (pause / resume / delete) holds the sandbox lock. Wait at least two seconds before retrying.

`Retry-After` is in seconds and tells the client when to retry. It does not mean that CubeSandbox continues deletion or starts a background retry.

Existing `404 Not Found`, `408 Request Timeout`, and `running` sandbox delete behavior remain unchanged.

## Explicit Pause / Resume

```python
sandbox.pause()                       # snapshot manually, free CPU/memory
# ... time passes ...
sandbox = Sandbox.connect(sandbox.sandbox_id, timeout=300)  # restore and reset the idle timeout
sandbox.run_code("print('back!')")    # carry on as if never paused
```

`pause()` does **not** cancel idle reclamation. With the default `on_timeout="kill"`, a later-paused sandbox is still destroyed once idle exceeds `timeout`. To keep a paused sandbox, pass `timeout=NEVER_TIMEOUT`, omit `timeout` (with no positive server default), or set a high `timeout` — see [Behaviour](#behaviour) below.

`connect(timeout=...)` can update the idle timeout whether the sandbox is already running or must first resume from a pause. For a running sandbox, a positive timeout only extends the deadline when the requested window is longer; use `set_timeout(...)` when you intentionally need to shorten it:

| `connect(timeout=...)` | Effect |
|---|---|
| omitted / `None` | keep the current timeout |
| `NEVER_TIMEOUT` (`-1`) | never time out after connecting |
| `N > 0` | ensure at least N seconds remain; a running or paused sandbox keeps a longer existing deadline, otherwise the timeout starts a new N-second window after connecting |
| `0` or `N < -1` | reject the request with HTTP 400 |

When connecting a paused sandbox, the underlying Resume may return HTTP 409 while another lifecycle operation is still settling; retry after the sandbox reaches a stable state.

The deprecated `resume(timeout=...)` keeps its legacy `0` behavior:

| `resume(timeout=...)` | Effect |
|---|---|
| omitted / `None` | keep the current timeout |
| `0` | keep the current timeout (use `set_timeout(0)` for immediate expiry) |
| `NEVER_TIMEOUT` (`-1`) | never time out after resume |
| `N > 0` | start a new N-second window from resume |
| `N < -1` | reject the request with HTTP 400 |

See [`examples/code-sandbox-quickstart/pause.py`](https://github.com/tencentcloud/CubeSandbox/blob/master/examples/code-sandbox-quickstart/pause.py) for a full demo. Cross-node Resume (S3 backend, `remote_status=ready`) is documented in [Cross-Node Snapshots](./cross-node-snapshot.md).

### CubeProxy cache after Resume

Resume recreates the guest NIC / host ports and rewrites the Redis sandbox proxy map. CubeMaster then best-effort purges CubeProxy `local_cache` via `POST /admin/backend_cache/delete` so traffic does not keep routing to the pre-pause IP (same-node 504).

For that purge to succeed, **CubeMaster and CubeProxy must share the same admin token**:

- CubeMaster: `cubeproxy.admin_token` (sent as `X-Cube-Admin-Token`)
- CubeProxy: `$cube_admin_token` in `nginx.conf` (see `CubeProxy/lua/admin_phase.lua`)

If the token is set on only one side, or the values differ, cache purge returns **403**, Redis is still correct, but CubeProxy may serve a stale cached backend until the entry expires. Align the token in deploy / Helm values whenever Resume is used.

## Platform-managed Auto-pause / Auto-resume

Most agent workloads aren't continuously busy: the user types code → the model thinks → the sandbox executes → it sits idle until the next turn. Auto-pausing during the idle stretch and **transparently resuming** on the next request can dramatically cut resource cost.

Cube exposes the exact same [`lifecycle`](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/auto-resume) shape e2b uses:

```python
sandbox = Sandbox.create(
    template="<your-template-id>",
    timeout=300,                      # 5 min of idle triggers on_timeout
    lifecycle={
        "on_timeout": "pause",        # at timeout → pause (instead of kill)
        "auto_resume": True,          # next request after pause → resume
    },
)
```

### Behaviour

- **`on_timeout="pause"`**: after `timeout` seconds idle, the platform schedules a pause. State flips to `paused`, the VM memory is frozen to the snapshot store.
- **`auto_resume=True`**: when any request next arrives for a `paused` sandbox (HTTP, `run_code`, file I/O, …), the platform wakes it up before the request lands. Callers never see the pause; typical resume latency is sub-second to a few seconds.
- If `auto_resume=False` (or unset), the sandbox stays paused until you explicitly `Sandbox.connect(sandbox_id=...)`. Useful for "wait for the user" workflows.

### Timeout reset on auto-resume

Each successful auto-resume **resets the idle clock** while keeping the same timeout length. The "resume → short use → idle out → pause again" loop can repeat indefinitely.

### What counts as activity

Any of these resets the idle clock:

- SDK calls: `sandbox.run_code(...)`, `sandbox.commands.run(...)`, `sandbox.files.read(...)` / `write(...)`.
- Direct HTTP traffic to a service inside the sandbox (e.g. via the URL returned by `getHost()`).

Sandboxes that don't opt in (no `lifecycle` argument) default to `on_timeout="kill"`: once they sit idle for the effective `timeout` the platform destroys them. This matches e2b's `lifecycle.on_timeout="kill"` semantic. Manual `pause()` does **not** cancel that kill: a later-paused sandbox is still destroyed when idle exceeds `timeout`. To keep a paused sandbox, pass `timeout=NEVER_TIMEOUT`, omit `timeout` (with no positive server default), set a high `timeout`, or send periodic activity to reset the idle clock.

### End-to-end examples

The platform ships two **mirror-image** end-to-end demos, one per `on_timeout` value:

- [`examples/code-sandbox-quickstart/auto-resume.py`](https://github.com/tencentcloud/CubeSandbox/blob/master/examples/code-sandbox-quickstart/auto-resume.py) — `on_timeout="pause"` + `auto_resume=True`. Creates a sandbox, idles past the timeout to trigger **auto-pause**, then issues a fresh request to trigger **auto-resume**, and verifies that both kernel memory and the filesystem are byte-identical across the cycle.
- [`examples/code-sandbox-quickstart/auto-kill.py`](https://github.com/tencentcloud/CubeSandbox/blob/master/examples/code-sandbox-quickstart/auto-kill.py) — `on_timeout="kill"` (the default). Creates a sandbox, idles past the timeout to trigger **auto-kill**, verifies that the next request fails fast with 410 Gone, that the sandbox no longer appears in `Sandbox.list()`, and spawns a control sandbox to rule out cluster-wide failures.

```bash
export CUBE_TEMPLATE_ID=<your-template>

# Auto-pause + auto-resume
python examples/code-sandbox-quickstart/auto-resume.py

# Auto-kill (irreversible)
python examples/code-sandbox-quickstart/auto-kill.py
```

## Operational Notes

### Cluster default idle timeout (`default_timeout_insec`)

When the client omits `timeout`, CubeMaster applies `cubelet_conf.default_timeout_insec` in `CubeMaster/conf.yaml` (one-click installs: `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/CubeMaster/conf.yaml`).

| Config value | Effect when the client omits `timeout` |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| unset or `<= 0` | **No cluster-wide idle TTL** — sandboxes never time out from idle |
| positive `N` | Default idle TTL of **N** seconds |

The repository ships with **no cluster-wide idle timeout** (`default_timeout_insec: -1`). Set a positive value (for example `300`) if you want the cluster to reclaim sandboxes that never pass an explicit `timeout`. Restart `cube-sandbox-cubemaster.service` after edits.

`create_timeout_insec` in the same section is unrelated: it only bounds the create/scheduling RPC deadline, not sandbox idle TTL. See [Service management — CubeMaster settings](service-management.md#cubemaster-settings).

- **Pause fidelity**: CPU registers, process memory, TCP state (with no external peer), and filesystem mutations all survive the snapshot. Outbound sockets the sandbox itself opened are dropped on pause and must be reopened by the application after resume.
- **Cluster coordination**: auto-pause is driven by `cube-lifecycle-manager`. The Helm chart and Terraform one-click both default to two warm replicas. Both replicas consume lifecycle events, discover CubeProxy replicas, and serve resume callbacks, while a Redis lease elects one replica for idle sweep/kill and stale-registry pruning. After a leader failover a sandbox may pause or resume once more; the next request auto-resumes it as usual (see the [Kubernetes FAQ](kubernetes/faq.md)). Per-sandbox Redis state transitions and CubeMaster lifecycle locks serialize effective pause/resume work across replicas.
- **Failure mode**: when an auto-resume RPC fails, CubeProxy returns `503 + Retry-After` to the client immediately rather than hanging on a long timeout. When the sandbox has already been killed (`killing` / `killed`) the proxy returns `410 Gone` instead, telling SDK clients to stop retrying.
- **Diagnostics**: `docker logs cube-lifecycle-manager` (control node) is the runtime log for the auto-pause coordinator. Look for `create event applied`, `auto-paused sandbox`, `auto-resumed sandbox`, `timeout-killed sandbox`. Each CubeProxy replica additionally exposes `GET http://<node-ip>:8082/admin/healthz` reporting `heartbeat_last_pushed_ms` (the last time it announced itself to the manager). The admin port defaults to `8082`; override it with `CUBE_PROXY_ADMIN_PORT` when that port is already in use on the host (CubeProxy uses host networking).

### Paused Resource Release & Scheduling Quota

When a sandbox is paused, its CPU and memory are physically reclaimed — but by default, the node resource accounting still counts `paused`/`pausing` sandboxes as "occupied" against the scheduler quota. This means: even after many idle sandboxes are paused, the host still shows no available capacity to create new ones.

To address this, Cube provides a **node-level tuning knob** `host.quota.paused_resource_release_ratio` (configured in `Cubelet/config/config.toml`), range `[0, 1]`, default `0`:

| Value | Behavior | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| `0.0` | Paused sandboxes retain full quota (identical to legacy behavior). Resume is always guaranteed — never rejected due to resource shortage. | Availability-critical environments where resume must never fail |
| `1.0` | Paused sandbox CPU/memory quota is **fully released** to the scheduler. Resume becomes best-effort — may be rejected when the node is full. | Maximizing deployment density; occasional resume failures are acceptable |
| `0 < r < 1` | Releases fraction `r`, reserves `(1-r)` as headroom. **Reserved quota still counts toward scheduler CPU/memory usage**, so pause-heavy nodes are **naturally deprioritized** — the scheduler won't keep piling new sandboxes onto nodes that already hold many paused ones. | Balancing availability against utilization |

**Configuration example**:

```toml
# Cubelet/config/config.toml
[host.quota]
paused_resource_release_ratio = 0.5   # release half, reserve half
```

**Resume admission check**:

When `ratio > 0`, every resume triggers a **local real-time admission check** — if the node lacks enough free capacity to accommodate the released fraction, the resume is rejected:

```
resume rejected by paused_resource_release_ratio policy: need 1024MB > quota 512MB
```

The rejection travels through the following chain to reach the client: `Cubelet (130409 Conflict)` → `CubeAPI (HTTP 409)` → `WebUI (capacity diagnostic)`. HTTP 409 is a retriable status — when other sandboxes are destroyed or paused later, freeing capacity, the resume can be retried.

**Important notes**:

- Disk and MvmNum are **not affected** by the ratio — pause snapshots still consume storage and the sandbox object still exists.
- `ratio=0` is the zero-value-safe default: if this setting is never configured, behavior is identical to previous versions. Upgrades won't cause surprises.
- This is a **node-level setting** — different nodes can use different ratios to accommodate heterogeneous hardware or tiered pools.
- When a large batch of sandboxes on a single node wakes up simultaneously and exceeds node capacity, the control plane returns 409 with precise quota numbers. For sandboxes on the S3 backend, the scheduler can fall back to another compatible node instead — see [Cross-Node Snapshots](./cross-node-snapshot.md) for the conditions and scheduler rules.

## Next Steps

- [Agent platform freeze / resume](./agent-platform-freeze.md) — manual pause retention, `connect` before envd, Volume vs snapshot.
- [Templates Overview](./templates.md) — sandboxes boot from templates; the template's build also shapes cold-start cost.
- [Quick Start](./quickstart.md) — the shortest path through "create sandbox → run code → tear down".
