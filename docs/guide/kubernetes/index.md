# Kubernetes Deployment

Install CubeSandbox (control plane + compute plane) with a Helm Chart on an existing Kubernetes cluster.

::: tip Difference from the “one-click script” deployment
This is the **native K8s path**: components run in the cluster and are managed by Helm. If you only have a single physical machine and do not plan to use K8s, see [Bare-Metal Deployment](../bare-metal-deploy.md) or [Quick Start](../quickstart.md) instead.
:::

::: warning Preview version warning
The current K8s deployment is a **preview** release. Known issues:

1. When compute nodes are under resource pressure, Pods may be incorrectly evicted by the K8s control plane, interrupting sandboxes. This is being fixed.
2. Compute-node upgrades currently have known issues: an upgrade recreates `cube-node`; on the Pod network that interrupts existing sandbox networking on the node, while on the default host network the netns survives the recreate. Read the [Upgrade guide](./upgrade.md) **before you deploy**.
3. The default host network is new and may interact with your CNI / Pod Security Admission (e.g. Cilium eBPF, `restricted` PSA). Test it in a non-production cluster first; see [Install · cube-node networking](./install.md#_8-3-cube-node-networking-and-pod-recreation).

**These issues will be addressed in later versions. You are welcome to try the K8s deployment path and report issues and suggestions via Issues.**

## Install order (required reading)

```text
① Cluster ready
    ↓
② Label nodes (and role taints)
    ↓
③ Prepare values
    ↓
④ helm upgrade --install
    ↓
⑤ Verify
```

The control plane uses native Deployments; the compute plane uses native `apps/v1` DaemonSets. Install needs only standard Kubernetes / Helm.


## Tested environments

CubeSandbox has been verified on Tencent Cloud TKE, Kubernetes, and K3s. Tencent Cloud TKE uses VPC-CNI as the CNI plugin; the other two environments use Flannel.

| Environment | CNI plugin |
| --- | --- |
| Tencent Cloud TKE | VPC-CNI |
| Kubernetes | Flannel |
| K3s | Flannel |
