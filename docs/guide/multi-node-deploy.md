# Multi-Node Cluster Deployment

This guide explains how to expand a single-node Cube Sandbox deployment into a multi-node cluster by adding **compute nodes**. Compute nodes run only the sandbox runtime components (`Cubelet` with the embedded network runtime, `CubeShim`) and register themselves to the control plane on the first machine.

:::: warning Production Use
If you plan to use Cube Sandbox in a production environment, please refer to the [Network Hardening](./network-hardening.md) guide to secure your deployment before exposing services to untrusted networks.
::::

:::: tip Prerequisite
You must have a working control node deployed via the [Self-Build Deployment Guide](./self-build-deploy.md) before adding compute nodes.

```

- The **control node** runs the full stack: orchestration (CubeMaster), node management (CubeOps), API gateway (cube-api), proxy (CubeProxy + CoreDNS), databases (MySQL + Redis), the bundled MinIO S3 volume store, and also acts as a compute node itself.
- Each **compute node** runs only `Cubelet` with its embedded network runtime. It registers to the control-plane `CubeOps` and receives sandbox scheduling requests from `CubeMaster`.

## Prerequisites

Each compute node must meet the same hardware and software requirements as the control node:

- **Physical machine or bare-metal server** (nested virtualization is not supported)
- **x86_64** or **aarch64** (ARM64) architecture with **KVM enabled** (`ls /dev/kvm`)
- **Docker** installed and running
- **Network connectivity** to the control node (specifically to `CubeOps` on port `3010` for node registration, and to the S3 endpoint — port `9000` with the bundled MinIO)

For the full requirements list, see [Self-Build Deployment — Prerequisites](./self-build-deploy.md#prerequisites).

## Step 1: Prepare the Release Bundle

Use the **same release bundle** that was built for the control node. Copy it to the compute node and extract:

```bash
tar -xzf cube-sandbox-one-click-<version>.tar.gz
cd cube-sandbox-one-click-<version>
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set the following variables:

```bash
ONE_CLICK_DEPLOY_ROLE=compute
CUBE_SANDBOX_NODE_IP=<current-node-ip>
ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_IP=<control-plane-ip>

# CUBE_S3_*: optional but strongly recommended. If missing, install proceeds
# with a warning and the S3 volume plugin stays disabled. See the tip below
# for how to fetch the values. With the bundled MinIO this looks like:
CUBE_S3_ENDPOINT=http://<control-plane-ip>:9000
CUBE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<from control node>
CUBE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<from control node>
CUBE_S3_BUCKET=cube-volumes
CUBE_S3_S3FS_EXTRA_OPTS=-ouse_path_request_style
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ONE_CLICK_DEPLOY_ROLE` | Must be set to `compute` for compute-only nodes |
| `CUBE_SANDBOX_NODE_IP` | This node's primary network interface IP |
| `ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_IP` | The control node's IP; automatically expanded to `<ip>:3010` for CubeOps node registration |
| `CUBE_S3_*` | Optional but strongly recommended. The volume plugin depends on S3; if missing, install warns and the S3 volume plugin stays disabled. See the tip below for how to fetch these values. |

::: tip Warns when missing
`install-compute.sh` checks `CUBE_S3_ENDPOINT`; if it is missing the installer prints a prominent yellow warning and continues. The node deploys normally, but the **S3 volume plugin stays disabled** until you set `CUBE_S3_*` and re-run the installer.

To fetch the `CUBE_S3_*` values backfilled on the control node:

1. On the control node, run:
   ```bash
   grep '^CUBE_S3_' /usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/.one-click.env
   ```
   Empty output means the control node itself has no S3 backend configured.
2. Paste the output into this node's `.env`.
3. Re-run `sudo ./install-compute.sh`.

With the bundled MinIO, also allow TCP 9000 from this node to the control node.
:::

You can also specify the CubeOps endpoint explicitly if it uses a non-default port:

```bash
ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_CUBEOPS_ADDR=<control-plane-ip>:3010
```

`ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_CUBEOPS_ADDR` takes precedence over `ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_IP` when both are set.

## Step 3: Install

```bash
sudo ./install-compute.sh
```

The compute-node install script will:

1. Install only `Cubelet` with the embedded network runtime, `cube-shim`, `cube-image`, `cube-kernel-scf`, and the runtime scripts
2. Start only the host process `cubelet`
3. Automatically point `Cubelet`'s `meta_server_endpoint` to the control-plane `CubeOps`
4. Register the node and report status through the control plane `/internal/v1/node-agent` API to CubeOps

## Verifying the Deployment

### Health Check

```bash
sudo ./smoke.sh
```

In compute-node mode, `quickcheck.sh` verifies:

- Local `Cubelet` and embedded network runtime health
- Reachability of the control-plane `CubeOps`
- That the current node appears under `/internal/v1/nodes/{node_id}` on the control plane

### Verify from the Control Node

On the control node, you can confirm the compute node has registered:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3010/internal/v1/nodes
```

The response should include the compute node's IP and a healthy status.

## Configure CubeMaster Scheduler Scoring

For multi-node deployments, configure CubeMaster's `scheduler.score` on the control node. If scoring is omitted, CubeMaster filters eligible nodes and then selects from the filtered node order, which can concentrate new sandboxes on the first eligible node until resource filters push traffic elsewhere.

Merge the following scheduler fields into the existing `scheduler` section of `cubemaster.yaml`. Keep your existing `filter`, timeout, and other scheduler settings.

```yaml
scheduler:
  # Keep your existing filter, timeout, and other scheduler settings.
  priority_select_num: 3
  score:
    enable_scorers:
      - real_time_weighted_average
    resource_weights:
      mvm_num: 2
      local_create_num: 3
      quota_cpu_usage: 1
      quota_mem_usage: 1
    plugin_conf:
      real_time_weighted_average:
        weight: 1.0
        enable_weight_factors:
          - mvm_num
          - local_create_num
          - quota_cpu_usage
          - quota_mem_usage
```

For multi-node clusters, set `scheduler.priority_select_num` to a value greater than `1` so CubeMaster randomly selects from the top scored nodes. The shipped default config uses `priority_select_num: 1`, which means scoring only determines which single node receives the next sandbox. Use `3` as a starting point for small clusters and tune it based on your node count. `scheduler.least_select_name` defaults to `random`, so it usually does not need to be set explicitly.

For the complete CubeMaster scheduler reference, including Cubelet node reports, quota / label / concurrency effects, and template redo after adding compute nodes, see [CubeMaster Scheduler Configuration](./cubemaster-scheduler-config.md).

After updating `cubemaster.yaml`, restart CubeMaster with your normal deployment procedure so the scheduler loads the new scoring configuration.

## Connect Clients to the Cluster

Client applications need the CubeAPI control-plane address and a route to sandbox services through CubeProxy. Choose the simplest data-plane access method that fits your client:

| Method | Best for | Wildcard DNS | Extra component |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| CubeSandbox SDK with `CUBE_PROXY_NODE_IP` | Python, Go, and Node.js SDKs | No | No |
| CubeProxy path mode | curl, backend services, generic HTTP clients | No | No |
| Wildcard DNS | Production, browsers, SPAs, official E2B SDK | Yes | No |
| E2B dev sidecar | Official E2B SDK in local development without DNS | No | Yes |

### CubeSandbox SDK: direct CubeProxy access

The CubeSandbox SDKs can connect directly to a CubeProxy IP while preserving the virtual `Host` used to route requests to the correct sandbox. This avoids wildcard DNS:

```bash
export CUBE_API_URL="http://<control-plane-ip>:3000"
export CUBE_PROXY_NODE_IP="<cubeproxy-node-ip>"
export CUBE_PROXY_PORT_HTTP=80
export CUBE_TEMPLATE_ID="<your-template-id-or-alias>"
```

Use the SDK normally after setting these variables. Control-plane requests go to CubeAPI; data-plane requests connect directly to CubeProxy.

### Generic HTTP clients: path mode

Any HTTP client can access a sandbox service through the CubeProxy path prefix:

```text
http://<cubeproxy-host>:<http-port>/sandbox/<sandbox-id>/<container-port>/<path>
```

For example:

```bash
curl http://10.0.0.5/sandbox/abc123/49999/health
```

Path mode requires no DNS or certificate setup and supports WebSocket upgrades. It is not suitable for SPAs that load assets from root-absolute paths such as `/static/app.js`; use wildcard DNS for those applications.

### Production and browser access: wildcard DNS

Host-based routing uses sandbox domains in the form `<port>-<sandbox-id>.<domain>`. Configure a wildcard A record that points to CubeProxy:

```text
*.cube.example.com  →  <CubeProxy public or private IP>
```

Configure CubeAPI with the same base domain:

```bash
export CUBE_API_SANDBOX_DOMAIN=cube.example.com
```

The one-click deployment includes CoreDNS for local `*.cube.app` resolution. It is intended for local use; production and shared multi-machine environments should use managed DNS or an internal DNS service. `/etc/hosts` cannot provide wildcard records.

See [HTTPS Certificates & Domain Resolution](./https-and-domain.md) for TLS and DNS configuration details.

### Official E2B SDK without wildcard DNS: dev sidecar

The official E2B SDK does not expose the CubeSandbox SDK's direct-IP option. When wildcard DNS is unavailable in local development, use the [E2B dev sidecar example](https://github.com/TencentCloud/CubeSandbox/tree/master/examples/e2b-dev-sidecar):

```bash
cd examples/e2b-dev-sidecar
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp env.example .env
```

For a remote cluster, configure:

```bash
E2B_API_URL="http://<control-plane-ip>:3000"
CUBE_REMOTE_PROXY_BASE="https://<cubeproxy-node-ip>:443"
E2B_API_KEY="<api-key>"
CUBE_TEMPLATE_ID="<your-template-id-or-alias>"
```

Then run:

```bash
python demo.py
```

`CUBE_REMOTE_PROXY_BASE` must point to CubeProxy, not to the sidecar's own listening address. When authentication is enabled, replace the placeholder API key with a valid key.

## Common Operations

### Stop Compute Node Services

```bash
sudo ./down.sh
```

In compute-node mode, this only stops `cubelet`. It does not affect the control plane or other compute nodes.

### Reinstall

To reinstall a compute node, simply run `install-compute.sh` again. The script automatically stops the existing deployment before installing.

### View Logs

| Component | Log Path |

## Configuration Reference

Compute nodes use the same `.env` file format. The following variables are specific to or particularly relevant for compute-node deployments:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ONE_CLICK_DEPLOY_ROLE` | `control` | Must be set to `compute` |
| `ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_IP` | empty | Control-plane host IP; expanded to `<ip>:3010` by default |
| `ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_CUBEOPS_ADDR` | empty | Explicit CubeOps address; takes precedence over `ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_IP` |
| `CUBE_SANDBOX_NODE_IP` | `10.0.0.10` | **Required.** This node's primary network interface IP |
| `CUBE_SANDBOX_NETWORK_CIDR` | `192.168.0.0/18` (from `config.toml`) | cubevs local network CIDR. Should match the control-plane value. IPv4 CIDR format (e.g., `10.100.0.0/18`), mask range /16–/24. Auto-detected for host network conflicts at install time. |
| `CUBE_SANDBOX_NETWORK_CIDR_SKIP_CONFLICT_CHECK` | `0` | Set to `1` to skip CIDR conflict detection (not recommended). |
| `ONE_CLICK_RUN_QUICKCHECK` | `1` | Run health check after installation |
| `CUBE_S3_*` | empty / filled by control MinIO | Optional but strongly recommended. The volume plugin depends on S3; if missing, install warns and the S3 volume plugin stays disabled. Copy from the control node's `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/.one-click.env` (fetch steps in Step 2 above); `ENDPOINT` / `ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `BUCKET` have no usable default. |

## Troubleshooting

### Compute Node Cannot Reach CubeOps

Verify network connectivity:

```bash
curl http://<control-plane-ip>:3010/internal/v1/nodes
```

If this fails, check:
- Firewall rules on the control node (port `3010` must be accessible)
- The `ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_IP` or `ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_CUBEOPS_ADDR` value in `.env`

### Node Not Appearing in Control Plane

If `smoke.sh` passes locally but the node does not appear on the control plane:

1. Check Cubelet logs: `/data/log/Cubelet/`
2. Verify `meta_server_endpoint` in the Cubelet config points to the correct CubeOps address
3. Ensure `CUBE_SANDBOX_NODE_IP` is correctly set to a routable IP (not `127.0.0.1`)
