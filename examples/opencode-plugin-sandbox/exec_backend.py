#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""exec_backend.py — run one shell command inside a CubeSandbox MicroVM.

This is the executor half of the OpenCode plugin integration. The plugin's
``tool.execute.before`` hook rewrites each ``bash`` call into an invocation of
this script; this script forwards the command to a MicroVM through the
E2B-compatible CubeSandbox API and prints the result back to OpenCode.

Contract with the plugin
------------------------
Invoked as::

    python3 exec_backend.py --session <id> --command <shell command>

* ``--command`` arrives as a single argv element, so the host shell never
  interprets it. Only the shell inside the MicroVM does.
* stdout / stderr are forwarded verbatim; the process exit code mirrors the
  command's exit code so OpenCode's usual success/failure handling still works.

Session affinity
----------------
A shell is only useful if consecutive commands share state. Each call runs in a
fresh MicroVM, created and closed within the call; what persists across calls is
the recorded cwd and environment, kept in a state file under
``CUBE_OPENCODE_STATE_DIR`` (default ``~/.cache/cubesandbox-opencode``) and
replayed into the next MicroVM.

The distinction matters: environment variables and the working directory carry
over because they are replayed as strings, but filesystem changes do not. A
directory created by one call does not exist in the next, and the wrapper falls
back to the default workdir when the recorded cwd is absent.

Two pieces of state are carried across calls:

``cwd``
    Emitted by the wrapper after the command finishes and stored host-side, so
    ``cd /tmp`` followed by ``pwd`` behaves as expected, provided the directory
    exists in the template rootfs.

``env``
    Variables exported by the command, captured the same way, so
    ``export FOO=1`` followed by ``echo $FOO`` behaves as expected.

Concurrency
-----------
OpenCode may issue several ``bash`` calls concurrently. Calls within one session
take a lock file so they do not interleave while updating the recorded cwd/env.
Different sessions run in parallel.

This is best-effort rather than a guarantee. After waiting ``LOCK_TIMEOUT``
seconds the call proceeds *unlocked* instead of failing, on the grounds that
losing a state update is preferable to refusing the user's command. With a
command timeout above the lock timeout, two concurrent same-session calls can
therefore overlap, and the last writer wins on the state file. A lock is also
reclaimed once its file is older than ``LOCK_STALE_AFTER`` seconds, so a holder
running longer than that can be displaced.

Requirements
------------
``pip install e2b-code-interpreter`` and a reachable CubeSandbox deployment.

def build_wrapper(command: str, cwd: str, env: dict) -> str:
    """Wrap the user command so cwd and exported env survive the call.

    The wrapper:
      1. restores the recorded cwd and environment,
      2. runs the command with ``eval`` inside a subshell,
      3. emits a JSON state block between sentinels from an ``EXIT`` trap.

    ``exit_code`` is preserved so the caller can mirror it.

    Two constraints shape this, and they pull in opposite directions.

    ``bash -c`` cannot be used: it starts a child shell, so a ``cd`` or
    ``export`` performed by the command mutates only that child and is gone
    before the state is read. The state would always report the wrapper's own
    cwd and environment, silently defeating the point of capturing it.

    Plain ``eval`` in the wrapper's own shell cannot be used either: a command
    ending in ``exit`` terminates that shell, so the state block and the
    exit-code line never run. The host then finds no sentinel and reports
    success for a command that actually failed.

    A subshell with an ``EXIT`` trap satisfies both. ``eval`` runs in the
    subshell, so its mutations are visible to the trap; the trap fires when the
    subshell ends normally or via ``exit``, so the state block and exit code
    are emitted in both cases; and an ``exit`` inside only ends the subshell,
    leaving the wrapper intact.

    One case remains outside this: a command that calls ``exec`` replaces the
    subshell's process image, which discards traps along with everything else.
    No shell-level wrapper can observe that, so no state block is emitted. Two
    consequences, handled separately:

    * The exit code is still recovered. The guest appends
      ``__CUBE_RC__=<returncode>`` when the wrapper produced none, so
      ``exec false`` is reported as a failure rather than a success.
    * The cwd and environment updates are lost. The previous session state is
      kept, so state is stale rather than wrong.

    The second point is a real limitation and is documented as one.

    The exit code is returned as ``None`` when no marker was found at all, rather
