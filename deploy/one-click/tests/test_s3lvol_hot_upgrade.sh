# Unit tests for the CubeS3lvol upgrade orchestrator's invocation contract.
#
# install.sh runs cube-s3lvol-hot-upgrade.sh **out of the unpacked package
# tree**, because the copy in the install tree is the one being replaced (an
# install from before this has an older script there, or none). That makes the
# install prefix something the script cannot derive from its own location, and
# something it must not silently get wrong: derived from the package tree it
# points at the temp directory the package was extracted into, the version
# directory is not found, and the script exits 2 having done nothing -- which
# install.sh reports as the whole upgrade failing.
#
# No other caller catches that: every other invocation is by hand, against a
# real install tree, where the derivation happens to be right. So the invocation
# shape is exercised here, on the tree layout install.sh actually produces.
