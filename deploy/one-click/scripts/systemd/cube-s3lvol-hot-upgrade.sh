# cube-s3lvol-hot-upgrade.sh -- swap the s3lvol target under a live sandbox
#
# Called by install.sh --mode=upgrade, before anything else is stopped. That
# placement is the whole point: an online flush needs the target that is running
# *and* the S3 endpoint it writes to, and both are gone by the time the rest of
# the install has been through.
#
# The new component is already installed under its versioned directory, and the
# bare name still points at the outgoing build. This script decides whether the
# swap can be done without taking a live sandbox's block devices away, does it,
# and puts the bare name back if it cannot.
#
# What makes it "in place": the target is killed outright rather than stopped,
# so the host's nvme_tcp controllers go into error recovery with their gendisks
# intact, and the replacement rebuilds the same NQN/(subsys, nsid)/UUID grid.
# Nothing here disconnects the initiator or unloads the lvstore.
#
# Usage: cube-s3lvol-hot-upgrade.sh <new-version-directory-name> [old-version-directory]
#
# The install prefix is TOOLBOX_ROOT, and it has to be given to any copy that
# does not sit in the install tree itself: install.sh runs this out of the
# package, where the directory above is the package and not the install.
#
# The old directory is passed in by install.sh, which has to capture it before
# it stages the new one: once the bare name has been switched there is nothing
# left to resolve it through. Without the argument -- a hand invocation -- it is
# read off the bare name here.
#
# Exit: 0  the target is on the new build (upgraded, or there was nothing to
#          upgrade because none was running)
#       non-zero  it is on the old one, or nothing is running. The caller must
#          not read this as "the install failed" -- the rest of the install is
#          independent -- but it must not report the upgrade as done either.
