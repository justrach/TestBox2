# cube-s3lvol-stop.sh -- ExecStop for cube-sandbox-s3lvol.service.
#
# What it does, by the state it finds:
#
#   1. Hot restart (marker for this boot naming a live target): the marker was
#      written by an upgrade orchestrator, so this stop is the one an upgrade
#      asked for. rcow_upgrade.sh, handed the candidate the marker recorded,
#      flushes and checkpoints online and then kills the target outright -- no
#      disconnect, no unload -- so the host only pauses I/O.
#
#   2. Planned stop (target alive, no marker): rcow_stop.sh does the full
#      teardown in reverse start order. bstore.json and the active registry are
#      left for the next start to attach, so planned restarts are transparent.
#
#   3. Target already gone: NEVER disconnect the NVMf initiator -- its
#      controllers are sitting in nvme_tcp reconnect, and a disconnect would
#      break the no-I/O-interruption guarantee the crash-restart design rests
#      on. Only clean target-side residue, so the next ExecStart can rebuild
#      the same NQN/NSID grid and the kernel reconnects on its own.
#
# Two further states are refused rather than served, because everything they
# could fall through to destroys a live target's namespaces:
#
#   - a marker for this boot whose pid is not a running target; it may be a live
#     intent this host cannot confirm, and the planned path deletes the gendisks
#     for one. The marker is left for the operator to resolve.
#   - a target running that the pidfile does not name.
#
# A refusal exits non-zero, which leaves the unit FAILED -- and the unit is then
# stopped while the target it would not kill is still running, so nothing here
# can be asked again: `systemctl stop` has no unit left to drive, and
# `systemctl start` is refused by rcow_start.sh's instance guard while that
# target lives. What picks it up is the upgrade itself, which drives this stop
# directly when there is no unit to ask, or an operator running rcow_upgrade.sh
# by hand. Not rcow_stop.sh, unless the outage it takes is what is wanted. That
# is the trade, taken deliberately: refuse and leave something inspectable
# rather than succeed by breaking it.
#
# The marker is what separates 1 from 2, and it is deliberately not writable
# from here: an operator asking for a plain stop must never get the path that
# leaves the lvstore to be picked up again.
