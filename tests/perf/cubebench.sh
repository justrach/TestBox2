# cubebench.sh - all-in-one performance benchmark script for CubeSandbox
#
# Run it from any machine that can reach a deployed CubeSandbox, typically the
# single-host install itself or the control node of a multi-node cluster. It
# needs cubemastercli plus a reachable CubeAPI and CubeProxy; everything else it
# discovers.
#
# Where you run it matters for one section:
#   - Section 3.3 measures memory with free(1) on the local machine, so it only
#     runs on a single-node deployment whose Cubelet is this machine. It is
#     skipped, with a note in the report, everywhere else.
#
# WARNING:
#   The run subcommand destroys ALL existing sandboxes before every measurement,
#   on every node of the cluster. Do not point it at a deployment with sandboxes
#   you care about. Existing templates are left untouched.
#
# PREREQUISITE 1 - build cube-bench (needed by the 3.x sections):
#
#     make -C examples/cube-bench
#
#   The 4.x sections instead need python3-venv plus network access, so the
#   script can pip install the cubesandbox SDK into a throwaway venv.
#
# PREREQUISITE 2 - raise the host quota on every Cubelet node:
#   The benchmark creates hundreds of sandboxes per node. With the default
#   host.quota, CubeMaster rejects creations with "no more resource" long before
#   the real capacity limit is reached, so the numbers are useless. Edit the
#   Cubelet dynamic config on each node (see CUBELET_CONF below, default
#   /usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/Cubelet/dynamicconf/conf.yaml):
#
#     host:
#       scheduler_label: "default-cluster"
#       quota:
#         mcpu_limit: 1000000
#         mem_limit: "4096Gi"
#         mvm_limit: 2000
#         creation_concurrent_num: 0   # 0 means unlimited
#
#   then restart Cubelet on that node so the new quota takes effect:
#
#     systemctl restart cube-sandbox-cubelet.service
#
#   The run subcommand checks this machine's config on startup and warns when the
#   values look too low, but it never changes them and never blocks the run. On a
#   cluster it can only see the node it runs on; check the others yourself.
#
#   WARNING: a raised quota lets the benchmark pack more sandboxes than the node's
#   RAM can actually back, so the density test (section 3.3) can drive the host
#   into a whole-machine OOM. Leave memory headroom and watch it while running.
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING - two failures show up often enough to name here:
#
#   "no more resource" (CubeMaster rejects the creation)
#     The node ran out of host.quota, not out of hardware. Raise the quota in
#     Cubelet/dynamicconf/conf.yaml as described in PREREQUISITE 2 and restart
#     Cubelet. Note that 0 or "" does not mean unlimited: Cubelet then derives
#     the quota from the node's real CPU and memory, which the benchmark
#     exhausts quickly.
#
#   HTTP 408 (the request times out)
#     Usually the host is stuck reclaiming memory. Check whether kswapd0 is
#     burning CPU, which typically comes from dirty page writeback:
#
#       top -b -n 2 -d 1 | grep kswapd
#       vmstat 1 5            # watch bo (writeback) and wa (io wait)
#
#     If kswapd0 is hot, leave the host more free memory (benchmark a lower
#     density) or tune writeback, e.g. vm.dirty_ratio / vm.dirty_background_ratio,
#     so reclaim is not waiting behind disk IO.

# Environment variables (run subcommand), all optional:

#                         (multi-node cluster: the control node)
#   CUBE_MASTER_PORT      cubemaster port, default 8089
#   CUBE_OPS_IP           CubeOps address used to list all registered nodes; defaults to CUBE_MASTER_IP

#   CUBE_BENCH_TPL_TIMEOUT  seconds to wait for the test template to reach READY, default 300;

#   CUBE_BENCH_RESET_TIMEOUT  base seconds to wait for a between-section reset to drain, default 60;
#                         the effective wait adds a per-sandbox budget on top of this floor
#   CUBE_BENCH_RESET_PER_SANDBOX_MS  extra drain budget per outstanding sandbox in ms, default 150;
#                         scales the reset wait with tier size so large tiers do not warn spuriously
#   CUBE_BENCH_RESET_POLL_INTERVAL  seconds between drain polls, default auto (2 + count/200, capped
#                         at 15); each poll is a full cluster list, so this scales with the drain size
#   CUBE_BENCH_MVM_MAX    hard cap on total sandboxes the memory-density sweep (3.3) will create,
#                         default 2000; stops the sweep before the host OOMs even if creation only
